# Introduction

Brighter Worlds is a fantasy tabletop RPG for going adventuring, crawling through dungeons, and playing through all of the OSR modules I’ve acquired over the years but haven’t gotten a chance to run yet.

It’s designed to appeal to a very particular sort of table, specifically my own. The base of the game uses the ultra pared-down ruleset of Into the Odd (more specifically the Cairn implementation of those rules) but additional complexity and crunch has been built back on top of that foundation.

My goal for players was to provide a system that would let them build unique characters, let them grow and gain new abilities as they adventure, and to make danger and the threat of death meaningful without being omnipresent.

My goal for the GM was to provide all of that to the players, without adding additional complexity to the GM facing rules. The game should be governed by a small set of simple rules, with GM rulings to fill the gaps. Building NPCs and monsters on the fly should be quick and easy. 

The way I’ve (attempted to) accomplish this is to make the more complex rules and systems both modular, and primarily player facing. Modular means that each subsystem contained within a player class generally only affects that class and any players who choose it. Player facing means the GM shouldn’t be doing bookkeeping for Class abilities, or even remember they exist most of the time. All that’s required is for the GM to make rulings as necessary.

And that’s how we got here. Rules light framework for the GM to interface with. Character creation that is hopefully complex and flexible enough to satisfy players and make every character unique, even within the same class. Advancement that combines earning XP and buying upgrades within your own class, but growing and learning through ‘foreground, diegetic growth’ tied into the fiction of the game.

Although I wrote this specifically for me to play it with my friends, I hope that others can find some use out of what I’ve written here.

Brighter Worlds is not done. Some of it is just plain unwritten, most of it is untested, and the editing leaves a lot to be desired. Expect this game to grow and change as time goes on.
