# Introduction
## Brighter Worlds
Brighter Worlds is a tabletop role-playing game designed for one Game Master and one or more players. It is heavily derived from Electric Bastionland, Cairn, and Macchiato Monsters along with several other games. If you’re unfamiliar with TTRPGs in general, or just the more lightweight open-ended subset of games, I strongly recommend taking a look at any of those three games which provide much better introductions and explanations than I could offer here. This game can be used out of the box as a complete TTRPG. However, it is designed to fit the idiosyncrasies of my particular table and my particular players. Feel free to use, modify, or throw away whatever parts you desire. If nothing else, the Callings should be relatively easy to port to any other game with Into the Odd in its ancestry, and to broader games with a bit more effort.
## Goals
Brighter Worlds is an attempt to solve a particular sort of problem I've found in playing RPGs. I'm a GM who wants simple, lightweight rules, which run quickly with minimal prep. However some of my players want character creation with lots of choices and options, along with mechanical advancement and growth. All of us want combat to be fun, exciting, and above all quick and decisive. 

My solution was to make the character options and mechanics primarily player facing, so the person at the table most interested in interacting with them is the person responsible for doing so. I’ve also made each Calling relatively modular to reduce the need for a player to read and know the entire book. All that should be required are the few pages of general rules, and the text on their own Calling’s page.
## Modular Crunch
Part of what this game is designed for is to appeal to players who like to build characters by assembling options and making choices, as well as players who like having their own little “fiddly bits” of rules and mechanics to muck around with. However, not every player wants this and with more complex rule sets with interlocking mechanics, each new ability or class feature contributes to the overall length and complexity of the game. My solution here is to try and give each Calling isolated mechanics. That is, a Calling can have a fiddly crunchy bit of mechanics, but it’s self contained and the player doesn’t need to know anything other than what’s on that Calling’s page (aside from the occasional reuse of lists). It also doesn’t require much from the GM aside from a final “yeah that sounds good”.

A big part of the goal for the structure of the Callings is to allow players to say, “yeah this is something I care about and want to be doing,” and choose a Calling that will support that type of play.
## Whimsy
Although the modules I’m running at my table are ostensibly OSR, grim, and dark the way my players tend to approach them is far more lighthearted and absurdist. They can be found: 

 * Politely knocking on doors before opening them.
 * Declaring that some new creature they met is their best friend (despite ample evidence to the contrary).
 * Spending considerably more time and effort debating the legality of their dungeon crawl than worrying about logistics and tactics.

I try to support this theme through the mechanics in a few ways. One is by giving Callings interesting tools to interact with the world and the people who live in it. Another is reducing lethality with the Mark of Death rule, while maintaining the decisiveness and consequences of combat, but making it so that the mostly likely consequence of Death is that things get weird. Most importantly the tone is carried by Evlyn’s incredible artwork.
## Inspirations
Brighter Worlds draws most heavily from Electric Bastionland, Cairn, and Macchiato Monsters as role playing game predecessors. Other games that played a role include Into the Odd, 24XX, the Whitehack, Bonepunk, Dungeon World, and Class Warfare. For fiction, the Demonic Sorcerer and Great Soul Shaman were inspired by Lois McMaster Bujold’s “World of the Five Gods” and her “Penric & Desdemona" series in particular. These books also form a good baseline for the type of irreverent adventure with lots of talking to people that I’m interested in. Blessed of Water, and to lesser extents the Alchemist and Witch, was inspired by Madeline Miller’s “Circe”. The Cleric of Small Gods was inspired by Anne Leckie’s “The Raven Tower” (someday I will write a game about simply being a large rock on a hill). “Kino’s Journey” and “Mushishi” are two additional useful touchstones for the tone and feel of the journey-style story that I’d like to capture with this game.
## Unfinished
Brighter Worlds is extremely unfinished. Most of the Callings have not been playtested, and parts of the rules are still being stress tested and changed (although the core bits are relatively stable now). It’s very likely that somewhere in the 100 spells and rituals there’s something horrifically broken, so use at your own risk.

On the to-do list is:
 * Create a bestiary including example "pre-gens" of each Calling.
 * Expand the GM Guidance section
 * Expand the conversion section

Expect things to change in future versions, and if you happen to play the game and have thoughts please do let me know (on twitter @AwkwardTurtle42, through my itch page, or anywhere else you can find me).
