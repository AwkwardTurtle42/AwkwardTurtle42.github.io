# Cast & Crew

This Cast & Crew are a collection of pre-generated characters, (eventually) one for each Calling. They can be used as pre-made characters for players in quick start games, or NPCs for GM use to populate the world (or as Friends! Pg 84). They also serve as examples for how a given Calling might be changed, modified, tweaked, or twisted into a slightly different shape to fit a player’s character concept.

This section is currently unfinished, it will be expanded and completedin future releases.
