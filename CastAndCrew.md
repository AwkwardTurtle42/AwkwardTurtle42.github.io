# Cast & Crew

This Cast & Crew are a collection of pre-generated characters, each based on a specific Calling. They can be used as pre-made characters for players in quick start games (just roll each of your Attribute Dice on the Starting Equipment Tables), or NPCs for GM use to populate the world.
