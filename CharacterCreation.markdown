# Character Creation

A character is mechanically made of Attributes, Grit, and a Class.


## Attributes

Each of your Attributes (STR, DEX, and WIL) begin at a d6.

Step up the die for one of your Attributes to a d8.


## Grit

Grit is a characterâ€™s ability to avoid being harmed. It represents a combination of defensive capabilities, awareness, and luck.

Your Maximum Grit is determined by your Class.


## Classes

All characters are generalists. Everyone can swing a sword, sneak around, or cast a spell. Classes define the things that put you ahead of the pack, the things that give you an extra edge or let you break the rules.

Your class gives you your Maximum Grit, a Core Ability, and some equipment. Each class has a series of Advanced Abilities that can be unlocked with earned XP.

[Choose a class](/Classes/), or roll a d12 to pick one randomly. Then create your character following the instructions in the class.
