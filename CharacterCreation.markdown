# Character Creation
## Attributes
Attributes represent both a character’s prowess and current status. Each of your Attributes (STR, DEX, and WIL) begin at a d6. 
Step up one of your Attributes to a d8.
## Callings
All characters are generalists. Everyone can swing a sword, sneak around, or cast a spell (given access to a Grimoire). Callings define the things that put you ahead of the pack, the things that give you an extra edge or let you break the rules.

Choose a [Calling](/Callings/).
## Grit
Grit is a character’s ability to avoid being harmed. It represents a combination of defensive capabilities, awareness, and luck.
Note the Maximum Grit listed in your Calling.
## Core Ability
Your Calling grants you a Core Ability that forms the basis of that Calling and the core of your character’s power.

Make any choices related to your Core Ability that your Calling requires, and make a note of what it entails. You are the primary person responsible for keeping track of what your character is able to do, and how your abilities work.
## Advanced Abilities
Each Calling has four Advanced Abilities that show ways your character might grow or develop as they progress through the world.

Choose one Advanced Ability to start the game with. The others can be unlocked by spending XP earned during play.
## Equipment
Most Callings start with equipment, weapons, or other useful items.

Make any item selections or choices required by your Calling.

Additionally describe what you’re currently wearing.
## Magic
Although any character can cast spells or perform rituals, not all Callings start the game with a Grimoire which stores that magic.

If you start with a Grimoire, or something that acts as one, choose the spells or rituals your Calling says you start the game with.
## Finishing Touches
Decide your character's name, tell the table a bit about them, and figure out how they fit into the adventuring party.
