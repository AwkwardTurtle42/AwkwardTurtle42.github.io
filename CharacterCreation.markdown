# Character Creation

## Attributes

Attributes represent both a character’s prowess and current status.

All three of your Attributes start at a d4.

Step up one Attribute twice (to a d8), and another Attribute once (to a d6).

## Grit

Grit is a character’s mental concentration and ability to avoid being harmed. It represents a combination of reflexes and situational awareness.

Your Maximum Grit starts at 1, plus 1 for each time you stepped up DEX and WIL.

*d4 DEX + d6 WIL = 2 Grit*

*d8 DEX + d4 WIL = 3 Grit*

*d6 DEX + d8 WIL = 4 Grit*

## Callings

All characters are generalists. Everyone can swing a sword, sneak around, or cast a spell (given access to a Grimoire). Callings define the things that put you ahead of the pack, give you an extra edge, or let you break the rules. 

[Choose a Calling](/Callings/). 

### Core Ability

Your Calling grants you a Core Ability that forms the basis of your character’s power.

Make any choices related to your Core Ability that your Calling requires, and make a note of what it entails. You are the primary person responsible for keeping track of what your character is able to do, and how your abilities work.

## Equipment

You start with a purse filled with 50 coins and a random item from each Attribute Table below.

Many Callings also grant additional equipment, weapons, or other useful items.  Make any item selections or choices required by your Calling.

Next, roll your Attributes on each Starting Equipment table to see what else you’re carrying. Roll each of your starting Attributes twice, then choose either combination of Flair and Item from their respective lists. 

*If you roll your d6 STR and get a 2 and 6 you can either have a Heirloom Flail or a Silent Bow.*

Finally, if you need any minor, mundane items to round out your character let the GM know now. Your character can be assumed to have collected small items relevent to their life prior to the start of the game, but after the first session if you need something you'll have to find it in play!

## Magic

Although any character can cast spells and perform rituals, not all Callings start the game with a Scroll or a Grimoire which stores that magic.

If you start with a Grimoire, or something that acts as one, choose the spells or rituals your Calling provides.
