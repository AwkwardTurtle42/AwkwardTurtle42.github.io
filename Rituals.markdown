[Random Ritual](https://perchance.org/bw-rituals)

## Performing Rituals

To perform a ritual, read it out of the Grimoire while performing any required actions and sacrificing any required [components]. 

Performing a ritual takes at least ten minutes, unless otherwise specified. 

If performing a Ritual from a scroll, the scroll is discharged afterwards and cannot be used for a full day.

## Ritual Scrolls

A Ritual Scroll holds a single spell. It acts exactly as a Grimoire but can only be used once per day.

The time of day does not change, and the movement of the heavens is halted within the affected area until the carving is destroyed. The carving must be the size of a person to effect an area the size of a small town. The size of a house to effect a large city, the size of a tower to effect a country, and the size of a mountain to effect the world.

The stats of the minion are determined by its size and shape. Anything beyond very basic instructions will dramatically increase the time needed to perform this ritual. The minion lasts until you perform this ritual again.
 12. **Curse Object** - Curse an object. The next creature to handle it will be cursed with bad luck, and be unable to rid themselves of that object. While they posses the object events tend to turn against them, and they re-roll any die that rolls its max value.
