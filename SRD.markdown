# Core Rules


## Attributes

Characters have three Attributes represented by dice ranging in size from d4 to d12. 

Strength (STR): Represents physical power, toughness, and endurance.

Dexterity (DEX):  Represents speed, reflexes, and precision.

Willpower (WIL): Represents mental focus, toughness, and endurance.

These present both a character’s prowess, and current status. If STR ever drops below a d4 that character dies. If DEX drops below d4 the character is paralyzed. If WIL drops below a d4 the character is catatonic.


## Saves

When you want to do something, describe how you go about it and the GM will tell you if it’s possible, and inform you of any obvious consequences of your action.

If the action carries risk or uncertainty, you’ll make a Save by rolling your appropriate Attribute die and trying to beat:



*   a 4, if the risk comes from the environment.
*   another creature’s Attribute die if they’re directly opposing you.

If you **win**by rolling higher, you’ll get what you want and avoid the risks.

If you **lose** by rolling lower, you’ll suffer the consequences and possibly fail your task.

If you **tie** by matching your target, you’ll have to make do with a compromise, tough choice, or succeed with a drawback.


### Save Modifiers

If you’re in a good position, but something could still go wrong, your Save is **_enhanced _**and you roll a d12 in addition to your Attribute die, and keep whichever is higher.

If you’re in a rough position, and the best you can hope for is only partly mitigating the risks, your Save is **_impaired _**and you’ll roll a d4 instead of your Attribute die.


## Dice

Dice range in size from d4 to d12. If an effect tells you to step a die up or down, move it right or left along this track:

 \
d4 &lt;-> d6 &lt;-> d8 &lt;-> d10 &lt;-> d12


# Magic

Anyone can cast spells and perform rituals, they just need a Grimoire to store them in.


## Grimoires

Grimoires are _bulky_ tomes which can store any number of spells and rituals.

Spells and rituals can be copied from one Grimoire (or other source) to another, but doing so takes time (about an hour), resources (fancy pens and ink), and removes the magic from the original source.


## Rituals

Rituals can be powerful and long lasting, but are often time consuming and inconvenient to perform.

To perform a ritual, read it out of the Grimoire it is stored in while performing any required actions and sacrificing any required components. This takes ten minutes, unless otherwise specified. 

Rushing the process may be possible, but will always carry a degree of risk.


## Spells

Spells are quick and easy to cast, but tend to have flashy and fleeting effects.

To cast a spell, hold the Grimoire in both hands and read the spell aloud.

If you have Grit, set your Grit to zero to cast the spell.

If you have no Grit, make a WIS Save:

**Win**: The spell is cast successfully.

**Tie**: The spell is cast successfully, but your WIL is stepped down.

**Lose**: You WIL steps down. Either you are knocked unconscious, or the spell misfires (your choice).


### Spells In Combat

When you cast a spell against a creature that is actively trying to avoid it, if the spell deals damage simply use that damage as a normal attack.

If the spell does not deal damage, roll your WIL as though it were a damage die. If that attack would deal Critical Damage, instead your spell takes effect.


# Combat


## Rounds and Initiative

When engaging in combat time is tracked in increments called Rounds. A Round lasts about 10 seconds, or enough time for someone to run across a room and perform one significant action.

During each round, each side of a conflict takes a Turn to act. Within a side’s Turn, each individual can act in whatever order they choose, although all declared attacks are resolved simultaneously (see below). During a Turn a character can move about 40 feet, and perform one significant action (make an attack, use an item, cast a spell, etc.). Any actions that carry risk require a Save as usual, usually against the creature you’re engaged with.

If it’s not clear which side should act first, initiative should be determined by the leader of each side should make DEX Saves against each other (_enhancing_ or _impairing_ the Save as usual).


## Attacking

To make an attack, roll your weapon’s damage die. The target of the attack subtracts their armor and reduces their Grit by the result. If there is no excess damage, the target was able to avoid or otherwise defend against the attack. If there is more damage dealt than the remaining Grit, the excess damage becomes Critical Damage.


## Critical Damage

Any damage dealt in excess of remaining Grit becomes Critical Damage. When you receive Critical Damage, make a STR Save with the amount of Critical Damage as the target:

Win: The damage is minor, you are not significantly harmed.

Tie: The damage is significant, reduce your STR but you remain upright.

Lose: The damage is severe, reduce your STR and become incapacitated.

An incapacitated creature is knocked down and completely helpless. Without assistance they will die within an hour.

If a creature’s STR steps below a d4, they die.


## Attack Modifiers

If you make an attack that is at an advantage (against an unsuspecting target, from higher ground, etc.) it is _enhanced_. Roll a d12 in addition to your other dice, and keep only the highest result. 

If you attack while disadvantaged (through cover, while blind, while restrained, etc.) it is _imparied_. Roll a d4 instead of your other dice.


## Blast

Attacks with the Blast quality affect all targets in the area. This can refer to actual explosions, to fireballs, to whirling blades and giant sized cleaving blades.


## Ganging Up

All attacks against a single target are rolled simultaneously, and only the single highest die is dealt as damage. This applies both to multiple attackers, and to single attackers wielding multiple weapons.


## Combat Maneuvers

You make an _impaired_ attack alongside a minor action, as long as you could plausibly do both. This covers attempting to disarm a creature, knock them off a cliff, or similar.

If your attack would be _enhanced_ you can make a normal attack alongside your action.


## What’s It mean?

Attacks that are reduced to zero damage by armor are totally deflected or completely harmless.

_An arrow pinging off your heavy armor._

Attacks that reduce Grit but do not cause physical damage are avoided, dodged, or repelled. 

_A sword thrust caught by your shield and turned aside._

Attacks that cause Critical Damage have slipped past armor and defense to make an actual impact on flesh. 

_Blocking one thrust with a shield while a second slips past._

A successful Save versus Critical Damage means the injury is minor.

_A dagger slashing too fast to dodge, leaving a bleeding cut across your shoulder._

A failed Save versus Critical Damage means the wound is serious, and lasting. Such wounds are potentially lethal if not treated, and will likely inhibit the wounded character fictionally even after they’re stabilized. 

_A spear stabbing entirely through a leg, causing the character to collapse to the ground gushing blood._


# Healing and Recovery


## Catching Your Breath

When you have a few minutes to catch your breath and drink some water, you restore all of your Grit back to its maximum. Doing so in a dungeon or hazardous environment may expose the party to danger.


## Attribute Recovery

Attribute loss can be restored with medical care, magic, or a lengthy rest in comfort.


## Deprivation

If you are deprived of vital needs for a full day (food, water, rest) you are _deprived_ and cannot regain Grit.


## Death

When your STR steps below a d4 you die. 

The rest of the table should take turns reading your Eulogy in memory of your character’s life. Once done, create a new character and rejoin the group. Prioritize expediency over realism.


### Optional Rule: The Mark of Death

Use this rule to increase character survivability, or to add an extra bit of drama to the death of a character.

When a character dies, they approach the Black River where Death greets them. The player describes who Death appears as, and what they can glimpse beyond the Black River. Then, they roll a d6:

1: The character is taken across the Black River by Death.

2-3: Death offers them a deal. If they accept the terms, they are returned to life.

4-6: It is not their time. They return to life marked by Death in some way.

If a character is already Marked By Death, the 4-6 result is replaced with the 2-3 result.


# Items


## Inventory and Bulky Items

You can carry as much as is realistic, but if you are carrying more than two _bulky_ items you are _deprived_ and cannot regain grit.


## Armor

Armor (i.e. 1 Armor)  subtracts its score from the result of damage rolls against you. Items, such as shields, that grant bonus armor only apply while the item is held (i.e. +1 Armor).

You cannot have more than Armor 3 in total. 

Single pieces of armor that grants 2 Armor are rare, and usually carry some sort of drawback or limitation.


## Ammo

Ammunition (arrows, bolts, bullets, etc.) are generally not tracked and considered to be unlimited in supply, unless specific circumstances would lead to it being in short supply. 

Unique or speciality ammo is tracked individually. 


## Optional Rule: Wilderness Survival

Use this rule to add pressure to return to long trips through the wilderness, and to make deciding what to carry and how many Supplies to bring an interesting decision. Supplies (_bulky_) can be purchased in most settlements and cities, and are an abstraction of food, water, and general survival equipment.

Once a day, when the party is away from easy access to food and water, the party picks someone to lead the survival efforts. That person makes a Save with an Attribute based on their approach (fishing, hunting, scavenging, etc.). This Save can be _enhanced_ or _impaired_ as usual based on the hospitality (or lack thereof) of the environment or weather conditions.

**Win**: The party manages to hunt, gather, or scavenge sufficient resources to get through the next day.

**Tie**: As a win, but everyone is annoyed or uncomfortable.

**Lose**: The party is _deprived_ for the next day unless a package of Supplies is consumed.


# Advancement and Growth


## Eulogy and XP

Your eulogy is the list of your deeds and accomplishments that will be read at your eventual death. Whenever your character does something noteworthy enough to be mentioned in their Eulogy, write down what it was and earn 1 XP. These moments can be heroic deeds, desperate acts, cunning plans, or even comical gaffs. They can be shared across the whole group, or individual to just one character. If there’s ever any doubt as to if something counts, the table votes.


## Class Advancement

Spend XP to unlock abilities and make your character stronger. Spending XP represents your character’s ability to grow and improve using only their own practice, experience, and training.



*   Spend 1 XP to gain +1 Maximum Grit
*   Spend 1 XP to increase a d4 Attribute to a d6. Each step requires 1 additional XP to advance.
*   Spend 1+N XP to gain an Advanced Ability within your own class, where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.


## Foreground Growth

XP is not the only way you will grow and change. You can gain new abilities or skills by seeking out magic, powers, people and opportunities. Gain leathery wings by eating the heart of a demon, open your inner eye by meditating for a week and a day with ancient monks, learn the formulae to the elixir of life by plundering the libraries of the Lich Mage.

Similarly, gaining access to new Classes is done within the narrative of the game. Getting access to a new Class usually requires significant, intentional effort.


# Character Creation

A character is mechanically made of Attributes, Grit, and a Class.


## Attributes

Each of your Attributes (STR, DEX, and WIL) begin at a d6.

Step up the die for one of your Attributes to a d8.


## Grit

Grit is a character’s ability to avoid being harmed. It represents a combination of defensive capabilities, awareness, and luck.

Your Maximum Grit is determined by your Class.


## Classes

All characters are generalists. Everyone can swing a sword, sneak around, or cast a spell. Classes define the things that put you ahead of the pack, the things that give you an extra edge or let you break the rules.

Your class gives you your Maximum Grit, a Core Ability, and some equipment. Each class has a series of Advanced Abilities that can be unlocked with earned XP.

Choose a class, or roll a d12 to pick one randomly. Then create your character following the instructions in the class, or roll a d6 to randomly choose one of the Starter Packages as a premade character.

# GM Stuff


## When To Roll?

The following process is to help the GM determine how to adjudicate situations, and when to call for Saves.



1. The player declares their intent, describing their goal and their approach.
2. Determine if the action is possible. Consider the situation, the player’s approach, their tools, abilities, skills, background, if they have help, and any other relevant details.
    1. If it’s impossible, tell the player. They can choose to revise their approach, or change their intended action.
    2. If it’s possible, continue to 3.
3. If it’s possible, then consider if there are any risks to the action.
    3. If there are no risks, or the risks are fully mitigated, the player’s actions can go ahead without any drawbacks.
    4. If the action would entail unavoidable risks, tell the player what those consequences are. They can choose to accept them, or revise their approach.
    5. If there are potential but uncertain risks, continue to 4.
4. The player’s action requires them to make a Save to avoid the risks.
    6. If the approach means that, at best, the risks will be only partly mitigated the Save is _imparied_.
    7. If the approach means the risks are unlikely, but still possible, the Save is _enhanced_.
    8. If neither a or b apply, the Save is rolled as normal.
5. Tell the player the potential outcomes as far as their character could plausible know them (always err on the side of giving too much information). The player can then choose to roll, or revise their approach.
6. Roll the dice, and honor the results.


## NPCs and Monsters


### General Principles

A starting point for any NPC would be 3 Grit, a d6 weapon, and a d6 in each Attribute.



*   Attributes: d4 is weak, d6 is average, d8 is noteworthy, d10 is strong and d12 is legendary. Adjust attributes only for significant exceptions to the average.
*   Typical creatures will have 3 Grit, hardy ones 6 Grit, and serious threats 10+. Avoid giving too much Grit or combat becomes a slog.
*   Use flavor and style to make NPCs stand out, not everything needs unique attributes or abilities.
*   Making monster abilities that trigger on Critical Damage is a good way to emphasize the threat or strangeness of aggressive NPCs.
*   Remember that Grit is the ability to avoid harm, not health. It’s a measure of resilience and gumption, not meat.


### Morale Saves

When an NPC faces daunting, terrifying, or dangerous situations they should make a WIL Save to see if they persevere:

**Win**: They push through the fear, or continue the fight.

**Tie**: They hesitate, falter, or flinch.

**Lose**: They refuse to go further, or flee the danger.

In battle, NPCs should make Morale Saves when they take Critical Damage for the first time, the first time one of their companions is taken down, or if the tide of battle turns obviously against them.

Other situations for Morale Saves include an NPC being presented with a situation dramatically out of their understanding, hirlinges being pushed to put themselves at significant risk or being asked to continue into an obviously dangerous situation.

As with all Saves, a Morale Save can be _enhanced_ (a courageous leader, promise of significant reward, being particularly oblivious) or _impaired_ (being directly threatened, the situation is hopeless, the evidence of danger is immediate and obvious).


## Making Magic

Spell effects should be fast, flashy, and fleeting. Spells can be cast repeatedly and essentially no cost, so avoid effects that would be annoying or unfun if used repeatedly.

Rituals can be more impactful and long lasting. If an effect has the potential to be problematic, add a required component or a requirement that is sufficiently inconvenient to properly temper how often it can be used.

Even more powerful effects can either be embedded in single use magic items, or rituals/items with significant or difficult to achieve requirements to use.


## New Classes

The key to any core class ability is flexibility and scope. A core ability should be evocative and interesting, and flexible enough that two players could both choose it without causing an awkward overlap within the party. A good test for this is to see how easy it is to create a number of Starter Packages that feel interesting and unique.

Class abilities should always _add_ options and capability. No abilities should ever limit the options of other characters, the goal should never be to put the GM in a position where they have to tell a player they cannot attempt something because it would step on the toes of another class.
