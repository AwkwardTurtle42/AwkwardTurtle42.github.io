# Artificer

## You Are An Artificer

You're good at taking things apart and putting them back together, *usually* leaving them better than they started.

You start with three **Masterwork Items** you're particularly proud of: a **Weapon** (1d6 damage), **Armor** (1 Armor), and a **Tool** (1 Improvement). Distribute 3 additional Improvements among these items and decide what exactly they are.

## Core Ability - Walking Workshop

You can upgrade mundane objects or create new ones with a single Improvement. They are *fragile*, unless significant time, effort, or specialized materials are put into their production.

When a *fragile* item is used, roll a d6 (for weapons and armor roll on Direct Damage):

**1:** It breaks immediately (and likely violently).
**2-3:** It’s damaged, and will break next time.
**4-6:** It’s fine for now.

Your **Masterwork** items return to their original state if broken.

### Artificer Improvements

* **Deadly:** Step up damage die, ignore Armor.
* **Heavy:** Step up damage die, add bulky. Effective at damaging structures.
* **Capsule:** Delivers a liquid on Direct Damage
* **Ranged:** Attacks at a distance.
* **Ethereal:** Deals Direct Damage to WIL, injures non-physical targets.
* **Paired:** You have two of them.
* **Entangling:** Deals Direct Damage to DEX, trips or staggers on Critical Hit.
* **Extra Protection:** +1 Armor, add bulky.
* **Ward:** +1 Armor against a specific threat.
* **Locomoting:** Grants a form of movement
* **Light:** remove bulky tag.
* **Transforming:** Swaps between types.
* **Concealed:** Collapses or hides.
* **Sentient:** Has a mind of its own.
* **Detecting:** Sense a specific thing, or grant a specific type of perception.
* **Special:** A unique quality or ability.

## Advanced Abilities

Spend 2 XP to unlock your first Advanced Ability. Each subsequent Advanced Ability's cost increases by two. (2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP → 8 XP).

* **Mystical Graft:** You can graft enchantments and effects from magic tools, weapons, or armor onto other items. This destroys the original item.
* **An Eye for Engineering:** With careful study you can always discern the purpose and function of a mechanism, as well as the best way to break or repair it.
* **Efficient Artificing:** You can use Walking Workshop to create fragile objects with two improvements, or non-fragile ones with one improvement.
* **Mule:** You can carry up to four *bulky* items without penalty.
