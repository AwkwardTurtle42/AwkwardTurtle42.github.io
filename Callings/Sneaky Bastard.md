# Sneaky Bastard

## You Are A Sneaky Bastard

*You’ve always been up to something. When people look one way, you’re going the other. There’s always at least one more ace up your sleeve. Of course all this has a tendency to ruffle feathers, so it’s a good thing you’ve got the perfect partner to watch your back… yourself.*

### Core Ability

**Self Cloning Technique:** You have the ability to split apart or create copies of yourself. Choose the style of cloning you use:

* **Split Self**, divide your physical self in two.
* **Shadow Clone**, you and your shadow can act dependently.
* **Illusory**, create images of yourself.

### You Start With

* Daggers (d6), you always manage to have another one secreted about your person.
* Ring of 6 Bump Keys, roll a d6 to open a lock: (1: the lock and key break, 2-3: the lock or key breaks, 4-6: nothing breaks).
* A Dramatic Looking Cloak

### Self Cloning Technique

* **Split Self:** Divide yourself in two. Your split starts with your Grit and a d4 in all Attributes. You may step down your own Attributes to step up the corresponding Attribute of your clone. If either half dies the missing Attributes are lost, although you may heal back to your maximums as usual. You are both halves of yourself at all times and you both have access to your inventory, although only one half may use a specific item at any given time.
* **Shadow Clone:** You can separate your shadow from your physical self. Your shadow is insubstantial and immaterial, but cannot pass through opaque objects. It is immune to physical damage, but vulnerable to magic and bright lights. Your shadow can hide in the shadow of another creature, and while there you can read their surface thoughts, and communicate to them mentally.
* **Illusory:** Create a number of illusory clones up to the number of advanced abilities you have. Your clones are insubstantial and intangible but are otherwise indistinguishable from your real self. You do not have to declare which of you is real until it matters, and you share the senses of all clones simultaneously. When attacking with clones if you would deal Direct Damage you must either declare the clone is actually you or reveal it as an illusion.

### Advanced Abilities

Spend 2 XP to unlock your first Advanced Ability. Each subsequent Advanced Ability's cost increases by two. (2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP → 8 XP).

* **Multifarious Copies:** When you create your clone you may freely change its physical appearance.
* **For He Can Creep:** Your footsteps make no sound, and you are impossible to see by mundane means while you are motionless in shadow. You may extend this effect to anyone you choose within 10 feet of you.
* **Snap:** Recall your clone to yourself, or yourself to your clone from any distance. Anyone touching you while you do so is carried along.
* **Pick Pocket:** While a creature is totally unaware of your presence (discounting clones) you may swap an object they carry with an object of similar size and heft.
