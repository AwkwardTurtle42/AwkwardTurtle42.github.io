# Animal's Companion

## You Are An Animal's Companion

You have formed a special bond with a creature. It will follow your commands and is unfailingly loyal. 

You start with your **Animal Companion** and a bag of their favorite snacks.

## Core Ability - Animal Companion

Construct your Companion by combining three perks with these base stats:

3 Grit, d6 STR, d6 DEX, and d6 WIL, and a d6 attack

*(A bird or other flying Companion requires you to choose the Flying Ability.)*

Should the worst happen, your companion will return to your side from beyond the Black River as a ghost. You can spend your own XP on your companion as you would on yourself.
