# Blessed of Water

## You Are A Blessed of Water

You have a pact with some watery patron. You might be the daughter of a river spirit, have been granted a boon by an ocean goddess, or did some great deed for the guardian of a particular cove. In any case you were granted a small part of their power, and can always hear their voice in the patter of rain, the burble of a creek, or the crash of ocean waves.

Name your Patron, and choose the Blessing they've granted you.

You start with a water skin, or some other vessel, full with a gallon of water.

## Core Ability - One With The Water

You are equally at home in water as you are on land. You can freely control a volume of water about the same size as yourself, if employed as a weapon it deals d6 damage.

### Water Blessings

* **Fluid Form:** Freely turn into water and back into your normal state.
* **Font of Self:** You can produce water at will, the same volume you can control per hour.
* **Water Sight:** Once per day when you immerse yourself in a body of water you may ask your Patron one question about something that water touches.
* **Thermo Regulation:** Freely change the state of water within your control (between gas, liquid, and solid). If used offensively, step up the damage your One With the Water deals.

* **Twice Blessed:** Choose a second Water Blessing your Patron grants you.
* **Liquid Construction:** You can shape water into tools and equipment. Weapons deal d8 damage, and armor provides 1 Armor. You can maintain a number of items equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you have. Additionally, step up the damage your water does while using One With the Water offensively. 
* **Watery Tongue:** You can communicate with any creature that claims water as its home.
* **Water Walk:** You (and any companions you choose to bring with you) may leap into a body of water, and emerge from the most recent body of water you were fully submerged in.
