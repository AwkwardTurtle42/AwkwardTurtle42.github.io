**Brighter Worlds** is a fantasy tabletop RPG with selective crunch created by David Lombardo ([twitter](https://twitter.com/AwkwardTurtle42), [itch.io](https://awkwardturtle.itch.io/)).

It draws heavily from Into the Odd, Cairn, Macchiato Monsters and Dungeon World.

Brighter Worlds is unfinished (v. 0.6.0).

A PDF version can be found [here](https://awkwardturtle.itch.io/brighter-worlds) although the PDF will often lag slightly behind in version (currently v. 0.6.1).

Most recent changes:

* Mark of Death optional rule made default.
* Fixed Chaos Sorcerer core ability not showing up on site.
* Archivist's Archive now works as a Grimoire.
* Slightly tweaked some Blessed of Water abilities.
