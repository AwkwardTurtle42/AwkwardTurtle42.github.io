[![Brighter Worlds](TitleImage.png "Brighter Worlds RPG")](https://awkwardturtle.itch.io/brighter-worlds)

**Brighter Worlds** is a whimsical fantasy tabletop RPG with modular crunch.

Writing & Layout by David Lombardo ([AwkwardTurtle Games](https://awkwrdturtle.games))

Fully illustrated PDF version, featuring [Evlyn Moreau](https://www.patreon.com/evlynmoreau)'s artwork, is available [free on itch.io](https://awkwardturtle.itch.io/brighter-worlds). This PDF is **not** currently at version parity with this SRD, instead it matches the [live site's alpha version 0.9.3](https://brighterworldsrpg.com/).

It is unfinished, currently at Beta Version 0.1, but approaching feature completeness.

## Recent changes

Pre-gens for each Calling + specific GM Guidance for each Calling are currently being written, but I didn't want to hold up these other changes until they're done.

* Great Soul Shaman renamed to Soulbearer (thanks Evlyn) and features new artwork (thanks again Evlyn).
* Tweaked character creation to avoid there being an "optimal" choice.
    * Now you write a Eulogy entry immediately and either get an extra equipment roll, or +1 XP to start the game.
* Tweaked the Devoted's Living Legend advanced ability to make it more immediately usable.
* Added the Reflexive Invisibility ritual, it replaces the Bone Sense ritual (which I hate so much and regret writing).
* All Callings now start with 3 Grit across the board. Not enough utility in making it variable to be worth it. Makes things easier to just start with one number. 
* Added some items to some of the Callings to make the "You Start With" sections look less empty with the lack of Grit listed.
* Tweaked the Archivist's "Leap of Logic" ability so it works more in line with Deep Lore.
* Added "Environmental Damage" to the GM Guidance chapter. This whole chapter needs to be organized/expanded.
