# Callings

## Alchemist

*Through branch and root you know how to unlock the secrets of the earth. You use this knowledge to wrench the very world to will.*

### Core Ability

**Branch and Bone:** You can distill plants, minerals, animal parts, and other ingredients into potion components. With the necessary components, you can brew doses of any potion whose recipe you know.

### You Start With

 * Recipe Book: (bulky) Acts as a Grimoire that also stores your potion recipes. Contains two potion recipes and the Locate Object ritual.
 * Alchemy Supplies
 * One complete potion for each of your starting recipes.

### Potion Recipies

A potion recipe must contain at least two dissimilar components along with a brewing process. Any potion effect is possible, but the required components and process may be esoteric or prohibitive. 

You start with two recipes already contained in your Recipe Book.

To create a new potion recipe, explain the desired effects along with the proposed recipe. 

The GM will tell you if it will work, or if one or more more of the following are true:

 * It will require one or more additional components.
 * It requires a laborious, time consuming, or difficult to achieve brewing process.
 * It takes a large amount of raw materials to produce a single dose.
 * It creates an unstable, volatile potion that must be used quickly or lose its efficacy.
 * The process is uncertain, and the final effect will depend on a random roll.
 * It will have an unintended side effect when consumed.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

 * **Dungeon Delicatessen:** You always know the best way to break down and prepare any creature for the safest and tastiest dining experience. When you cook and eat a monster organ temporarily gain a lessened version of an associated trait or ability. Lasts until you eat your next meal.

 * **Homebrewer:** You can brew alcoholic beverages with mild potion effects. Beverage recipes require only one component plus a fermentable (grain, fruit, sugar, etc.). 
 * **Topical Treatment:** You can produce potions that are applied in ways other than drinking, such as breathable fumes, topical ointments, or smeared onto weapons.

## Animal's Companion

*Ranger, beastmaster, wildspeaker, hunter… the labels don’t matter, what’s important is that your companion is by your side. Your bond extends to the ends of the world and beyond.*

### Core Ability

**Animal Companion:** You have formed a special bond with a creature. It will follow your commands and is unfailingly loyal. Should the worst happen, your companion will return to your side from beyond the Black River as a ghost. You can spend your own XP on your companion as you would on yourself.

### You Start With

 * Your Companion
 * A Bag of Beast Snacks (whatever your companion prefers)

### Animal Companion Abilities

Construct your Companion by combining three abilities with these base stats:

3 Grit, d6 STR, d6 DEX, and d6 WIL, and a d6 attack

*(A bird or other flying Companion requires you to choose the Flying Ability.)*

 * **Big:** Step up STR and Attack.

* Mind Meld: You can share thoughts and senses with your Animal Companion from any distance.
* Blink Bud: You can teleport to your Animal Companion, teleport your Animal Companion to you, or swap places no matter the distance.


## Archivist

*You’ve always liked knowing things. Collecting information and stories like a squirrel collecting nuts for the winter. Frustrated with incomplete, inconsistent, and obviously biased records you’ve emerged from your study to do first hand research and correct the record.*

### Core Abilities

**Expert Reader:** No matter the language, culture, code, cypher, or style you can always quickly discern the intent and meaning of any written language.

**Deep Lore:** You are a master at collecting and collating information. Any Topic stored within your Archive is always at your fingertips.

### You Start With

* Your Archive (*bulky*): Acts as a Grimoire that also stores your Topics. Starts with one Topic of information based on your prior studies and one ritual of your choice.

* An extra piece of WIL Starting Equipment, rolled with d10s.

### Your Archive

Your Archive acts as a Grimoire, and can store spells and rituals in addition to storing your knowledge. 

**Deep Lore:** The first time you encounter something that falls within a Topic recorded in your Archive, you may ask the GM a single question about it. Further questions will take time to look up, or require further research. 

It takes six hours to record a new Topic of information into your Archive from any source of knowledge. 

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Office Assistant:** Whether due to accumulated knowledge or through some arcane rite, your Archive has awoken into a sentient, floating being. Casting spells still requires you to hold the Archive to read from it.
* **Monster Manual:** Thoroughly examine a creature to record it as a Topic in your Archive. When you take the time to lecture from your notes, you and any who listen gain +1 armor against those creatures during the next combat, and can easily identify weaknesses.
* **Psychometry:** You can read an object’s history just by touching it. When you handle an object you can sense events that have happened to it. Emotionally charged and recent events take precedence, but with careful study you may ask specific questions.
* **Leap of Logic:** Your years of study have developed into a startlingly accurate intuition. The first time you encounter a situation (or person), you may ask the GM a single yes or no question about it (or them).


## Artificer

*Your habit of always taking things apart to learn how they worked didn’t always endear you to people. When you started putting things back together people were mollified. Once they realized the things you’d put back together were better than before? That’s when you got popular.*

### Core Ability

**Walking Workshop:** You can upgrade mundane objects or create new ones with a single improvement. They are fragile, unless significant time and effort is put into their production.

When a fragile item is used, roll a d6 (for weapons and armor roll on Direct Damage):

**1:** It breaks immediately (and likely violently).
**2-3:** It’s damaged, and will break next time.
**4-6:** It’s fine for now.

### You Start With

* Your Artificing Tools
* **Masterwork Weapon** (1d6)
* **Masterwork Armor** (1 Armor)
* **Masterwork Item** (1 Improvement)
* Distribute 3 additional improvements among your Masterworks.

* **Heavy:** Step up damage die, add bulky. Effective at damaging structures.
* **Capsule:** Delivers a liquid on Direct Damage
* **Ranged:** Attacks at a distance.
* **Ethereal:** Deals Direct Damage to WIL, injures non-physical targets.
* **Paired:** You have two of them.
* **Entangling:** Deals Direct Damage to DEX, trips or staggers on Critical Damage.
* **Extra Protection:** +1 Armor, add bulky.
* **Ward:** +1 Armor against a specific threat.
* **Locomoting:** Grants a form of movement
* **Light:** remove bulky tag.
* **Transforming:** Swaps between types.
* **Concealed:** Collapses or hides.
* **Sentient:** Has a mind of its own.
* **Detecting:** Sense a specific thing, or grant a specific type of perception.
* **Special:** A unique quality or ability.

### Advanced Abilities

* **Mystical Graft:** You can graft enchantments and effects from magic items, weapons or armor onto something else. This destroys the original item.
* **An Eye for Engineering:** With careful study you can always discern the purpose and function of a mechanism, as well as the best way to break or repair it.
* **Efficient Artificing:** You can use Walking Workshop to create fragile objects with two improvements, or non-fragile ones with one improvement.
* **Mule:** You can carry up to four *bulky* items without penalty.

## Bag of Bones

*You're a walking, talking skeleton. Devoid of life and yet alive. Perhaps your state is the result of a run-in with a grumpy necromancer. Or maybe a ritual for lichdom went badly. Or did you get bored of guarding a dungeon, and decide to try your luck with a life of adventure? Your status as a bag of bones means you're harder to kill (a second time) but making friends is perhaps a bit more difficult now.*

### Core Ability

**Living Death:** You're a skeleton. You're made of bones and animated by some supernatural force. You’re hard to kill, and don’t stay down for long.

### You Start With

* A **Lack of Flesh**
* A **Fearsome Visage**

### No Body to Love

Your **Lack of Flesh** grants you +1 Armor against physical damage.

Your **Fearsome Visage** will be initially frightening to most creatures, unless you take measures to obscure your form.

You do not require food, water, or sleep. 

As long as your skull remains intact, you cannot fully die.

Direct Damage you suffer never overflows your current STR die. When you take Critical Damage, parts of your body are knocked off. You don’t restore STR by resting, but instead by replacing lost or damaged bones.

You may temporarily step down your STR to detach parts of your body which you retain control of.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **No Bones About It:** You can incorporate other bones into your body to grant yourself an innate ability of the original creature. Unless extreme measures are taken the grafted bones are [fragile]((#artificer-1)) and risk breaking after activating the borrowed ability.
* **Your Bones Are Your Money:** You can remove bones from your body to offer in trade (causing a loss of STR). The person receiving your bones will believe they are valuable and greatly desirable. This lasts until midnight at which point the glamour is removed and they become aware they received nothing more than old bones.
* **Humerus Presence:** You've developed a way of walking and talking that changes you from frightening to funny. Rather than an initial reaction of fear, you can choose for you first impression to be that of a harmless and hilarious bony jester.
* **Skeleton Crew:** Animate a dead creature's skeleton as a mount, minion, or pet. It has stats as it did in life, but falls apart and must be reanimated upon taking Critical Damage. Follows orders but otherwise has the intelligence of a moderately bright dog. You can maintain a number of animated skeletons equal to the number of Advanced Abilities you have.


## Blessed of Water

*Were you granted a boon by an ocean goddess? Are you the daughter of a river spirit? Perhaps you did some great deed for the guardian of a particular cove? Your watery patron granted you a part of itself and bound you to water. They are not a dominant presence in your journey, but their support is constant and you hear their voice in the patter of rain, the burble of a creek, or the crash of ocean waves.*

### Core Ability

**One With The Water:** You are equally at home in water as you are on land. You can freely control a volume of water about the same size as yourself, if employed as a weapon it deals d6 damage.

Name your Patron (the spirit, body, or source of water that has claimed you), and choose the blessing it grants.

### You Start With

* A waterskin
* A small, impossible token from your Patron

### Water Blessing

Choose the blessing your Patron grants you

* **Fluid Form:** Freely turn into water and back into your normal state.
* **Font of Self:** You can produce water at will, the same volume you can control per hour.
* **Water Sight:** Once per day when you immerse yourself in a body of water you may ask your Patron one question about something that water touches.
* **Thermo Regulation:** Freely change the state of water within your control (between gas, liquid, and solid). If used offensively, step up the damage your One With the Water deals.
* **Tip Of The Iceberg:** Your volume of water you can control expands 10 fold.
* **Healing Waters:** Stabilize wounds by pouring water over them. Restore a damaged Attribute to maximum after 6 hours.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Twice Blessed:** Choose a second Water Blessing your Patron grants you.
* **Liquid Construction:** You can shape water into tools and equipment. Weapons deal d8 damage, and armor provides 1 Armor. You can maintain a number of items equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you have. Additionally, step up the damage your water does while using One With the Water offensively. 
* **Watery Tongue:** You can communicate with any creature that claims water as its home.
* **Water Walk:** You (and any companions you choose to bring with you) may leap into a body of water, and emerge from the most recent body of water you were fully submerged in.

## Cleric of Small Gods

*You carry a small god around with you. You protect it, rather than the other way around. Possibly a baby god, a god of a small concept, a recently reincarnated god, a local god whose home was destroyed, or a ‘killed’ god. Regardless you are bound to it, and may speak with its words to alter the world around you.*

### Core Ability

**Words of God:** Gods can speak only truth. When you speak with the words of your god if the words are not true, your god’s power will attempt to make it true. 

Define the Domain of your god. 

### You Start With

* Your Small God
* A d8 Domain Die
* Holy Vestments

### Words of God

When you attempt to make something true by speaking with the words of your god, you risk the universe rejecting your statement.

Start with your Domain die, then adjust based on your intended outcome. If the die would step below a d4 the statement is impossible, if it would step above a d12 it happens without a roll. Otherwise, roll it as a normal Save. 

If you succeed the statement takes effect.

If you fail the universe rebels against your statement. Step down your Domain Die and suffer backlash (your statement works against you, the effects are too wide or narrow in scope, or it goes wrong in some other way).

Domain die loss is restored through offerings or religious rites for your God.

Step down your Domain die if the statement:

* Impacts things outside your line of sight.
* Directly contradicts the natural working of the world.
* Describes a long lasting effect (step down twice if permanent).
* Is expansive in scope.
* Is a poor fit for your god’s Domain.

Step up your Domain Die if the statement:

* Impacts only things you are touching.
* Is copacetic with the natural working of the world.
* Describes a fleeting effect.
* Is limited in scope.
* Is a perfect fit for your god’s Domain.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Gemini:** Your god has a second Domain, complementary in some way to the first.
* **Holy Site:** Spend a week and give a suitably impressive offering to create a holy site for your god. It shields those within from outside influence, and you may teleport yourself and your companions between holy sites.
* **Offerings:** Make offerings to step up the Domain Die. Minor offerings last for a single statement, significant ones last for a day, and major offerings like establishing a church and congregation last indefinitely.
* **Divine Colleagues:** Your god can always tell you which (if any) god or spirit claims an area, as well as how to contact them.


## Crystal Wizard

*The spheres talk. They speak in frequencies and tones inaudible to all living things. You’ve discovered that crystals, when prepared in particular ways, can resonant with this divine conversation. Others may scoff at your talk of the mystic resonance of quartz, or sympathetic vibrations of tourmaline, but you know that by listening carefully you can access powers beyond the ken of your contemporaries.*

### Core Ability

**Crystal Wizardry:** Your have harnessed the mystically resonant nature of crystals to enhance your magic. You can condense your rituals into Storage Crystals to perform them without effort, store your Grimoire within a crystal, and learn new magics by attuning to the crystal frequencies of the universe.

### You Start With

* Your **Crystal Grimoire** Containing 1 Spell and 2 Rituals of your Choice.
* An **Arcane Storage Crystal** attuned to a Ritual in your Grimoire.

### Crystal Wizardy

**Arcane Storage Crystals:** You may attune your Storage Crystals with a ritual from your Grimoire. Attuning a crystal this way takes 6 hours, but does not require your constant attention. You can still perform attuned rituals out of your Grimoire as usual.

Discharge a Storage Crystal to perform the attuned ritual immediately (a single combat round rather than 10 minutes), and without needing to sacrifice any components. Once discharged, a crystal must be attuned to a ritual to be used again.

Creating a new Arcane Storage Crystals costs 1 permanent Max Grit. Each crystal is bound to you (either physically or magically) and cannot be lost or stolen.

**Crystal Grimoire:** Your Grimoire is mystically bonded to a crystal embedded somewhere on your body. When not in use, the Grimoire is stored within the crystal, and if destroyed or lost it will reform within that crystal in an hour.

**Crystal Research:** Any time you spend XP choose a new ritual to add to your Grimoire.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Crystal Sight:** Embed a “third eye” crystal onto your body, allowing you to see mystical, spiritual, and other non-physical entities and effects.
* **Soul Cage:** Store your soul in your Crystal Grimoire. You cannot die as long as it’s intact. If your body is destroyed transferring the crystal into a new body allows you to inhabit it.
* **Telegraphic Crystals:** You can pair crystals such that things which effect one will effect the other. Sound, sight, and magic or other mystical effects are transmitted.
* **Capture Crystals:** Create special Capture Crystals by spending 1 permanent Max Grit. Use these crystals to capture the souls of recently killed creatures, or weakened or subservient spirits. Summon the captured creatures as you would cast a spell (setting your Grit to 0 or making a WIL Save). You are deprived as long as you maintain the summon. Particularly powerful souls and spirits may take additional resources or incentive to capture, or be difficult to control.

## Demonic Sorcerer

*A spirit of chaos, better known as a demon, has made its home in your head. In exchange for the shelter your body provides, it grants you access to the knowledge and skills its picked up from prior hosts. Sometime, when you die, it will leap to a new body and pass along the skills and knowledge it learned from you, but you might prefer not to think about that.*

### Core Ability

**Demonic Passenger:** You have a demon in your brain which acts as a hands free Grimoire, a magical tutor, and a repository of ancient knowledge.

### You Start With

* **The Demon In Your Brain:** It knows one random spell and one random ritual, as well as one spell and one ritual of your choice.
* An Unusual Choice of Clothing (Your Demon insists on it).

### Your Demon

You have a spirit of chaos living within your brain. As a being of pure spirit it cannot exist or interact with the material world on its own, and requires your body to do either.

**Inherited Knowledge:** Choose a Topic based on your Demon’s prior host. You may ask questions about that Topic as per the [Archivist’s Deep Lore ability]((#archivist-1)).

Anytime you spend XP, your Demon recalls a random spell or ritual (choose which) from a prior host.

**Magical Storage:** Your Demon stores spells and rituals as though it were a Grimoire. Transferring spells or rituals into it removes them from the original source as usual.

**Hands Free Spellcasting:** Using your Demon’s power you can cast spells while keeping your hands free for other activities.

You can have your Demon cast spells for you by stepping your WIL down instead of the usual costs (setting your Grit to zero or making a WIL Save).

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Demonic Sight:** Your Demon has learned to share its spiritual senses with you, allowing you to sense the presence and nature of nearby magical or supernatural energies.
* **Backseat Driver:** If you are ever knocked unconscious or have your mind impaired in any way, you can choose to have your Demon take over and control your body instead.
* **Primal Chaos:**  Set your Grit to zero, or destroy a delicate, fragile, or complex object in your possession, to hurl a d10 damage orb of pure chaos which will rust metal, rot wood, or decay what it touches.
* **Demonic Expression:** Ongoing exposure to otherworldly energies has induced a unique mutation. For example: a demonic eye that sees true names, a scaled arm that steals secrets, or translucent skin that let's you sink into shadows.

## Devoted

*You are devoted to something larger than yourself. It might be a deity, an organization, or simply an ideal. Whatever it is, your devotion to it grants you strength beyond mortal ken. Whether it is power granted to you, or pulled from within, your devotion guides your actions.*

### Core Ability

**Devoted Oath:** Choose a vow you must live by, and two boons your devotion grants you. If you break your vow, you lose your boons for a year and a day, or until you make amends. 

### You Start With

* Decorated Armor (1 Armor) 
* An extra piece of STR Starting Equipment, rolled with d10s.

### Vow

These apply only to you, not your companions.

* **Honesty:** You may not tell a lie, or engage in dishonest tactics.
* **Poverty:** You may not own money, gold, or gems.
* **Mercy:** You must accept offers of surrender, and you must honor good faith requests for assistance.
* **Stability:** You must complete any task, journey, or quest you undertake.
* **Nonviolence:** You may never initiate violence unless it is in defense of yourself or another.
* **Observance:** You must complete a ritual or task (something inconvenient) in each location you visit.

### Boons

* **By Will Sustained:** You do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.
* **Unsullied Truth:** You always know if someone is lying, or if something is hidden by illusion or glamour in your presence.
* **Can’t Stop Won’t Stop:** Direct Damage you suffer never overflows your current STR die. After you take Critical Damage restore your Grit to Max.
* **Weapon of Faith:** Choose an improvement from the Artificer’s Improvement list (Pg 27). Weapons you hold gain that Improvement.
* **Healing Touch:** Stabilize a wound immediately. With a night’s focus completely restore an Attribute to Max. 
* **Minor Miracle:** You have the ability to perform a minor miracle related to your devotion.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Doubly Devoted:** Take a second Vow, and gain two additional Boons.
* **Living Legend:** Choose your Name, Oath, or a Eulogy Entry you haven't previously chosen and put a tick next to it. Based on the chosen element, force a strong reaction from an NPC: pick two from Fear, Hate, Respect, and Adoration. The GM will pick one of those two to be true.
* **Constant Vigilance:** You are never taken by surprise. If there’s a question as to who acts first in a situation, the answer is you.
* **Always Prepared:** You carry a bag which can be opened at any time to reveal a useful, mundane item of your choice. You can do so again once you’ve been somewhere you could have restocked it.

## Grimblade

*You are a grimblade and you have a grimblade, a unique and very large weapon that you’ve learned the trick of putting spells into. Whether you physically inscribe it onto a meteor metal blade, or embed the spells into a crystal hammer, you find this eminently more practical than lugging a big book around.*

### Core Ability

**Grimblade:** You have a mystical weapon capable of storing spells (but not rituals) as though it were a Grimoire. It is any type of melee weapon, made of some unusual material. Your Grimblade is indestructible and you always know where it is.

### You Start With

* **Your Grimblade:** (d10, *bulky*), containing 2 spells of your choice.

### Grimblade

Your Grimblade acts as a Grimoire which can only store spells. It can take the form of engraving arcane words onto the flat of a great two handed blade, embedding mystic energy into the crystalline head of a massive hammer, or simply bashing people about the head with a very large book.

**Kinetic Spellcasting:** If you deal Direct Damage (this does not require Critical Damage) with your Grimblade you may immediately cast a spell ignoring the usual costs. You do not set your Grit to zero or make a Save. 

You can still cast spells from it as usual, but if you cast a spell while at zero Grit you roll the Save with your STR rather than your WIL.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Hammerspace:** You can store your Grimblade in a sub dimensional space (a Mary Poppins bag, a small portal, a tattoo, etc.) where it can be retrieved instantly.
* **Spell Disruption:** You can destroy weak (and disrupt powerful) ongoing spells and enchantments with your Grimblade. If there is risk of magical backlash, make a STR Save to avoid it.
* **Mystic Strike:** Set your Grit to zero to deal max damage on an attack. You can only do this if you’re not already at zero Grit.
* **I, Grimblade:** Whether through the magic stored within it or from some other means, your Grimblade has become sentient and ambulatory. It can float, act, and attack on its own. Kinetic Spellcasting still requires you to be wielding the blade yourself to function.

## Runewright

*You are a runewright, you imbue and channel power through engraved symbols of power. You are no wizard. You’re above running around shooting crude magic from your fingertips, blasting things with fireballs. Runes are sophisticated. Runes are subtler, slower, and longer lasting than spells. Anyone can pick up a spellbook and cast a spell, crafting runes takes refinement. And you are refined.*

### Core Ability

**Runic Magic:** You can inscribe runes that incorporate one Element, one Verb, and one Subject. Activate an inscribed rune with a fresh drop of your blood and reducing your Max Grit by 1. You can deactivate a rune at will to recover the spent Max Grit.

### You Start With

* Knowledge of 2 **Elements**, 2 **Verbs**, and 2 **Subjects**
* Etching or Drawing Tools
* Flawless handwriting

### Rune Components

Runic magic is subtler than both Spells and Rituals, dealing mostly with modifying existing things. The effects are long lasting, but generally less powerful.

When you inscribe a rune, tell the GM what your intended effect is and what components you plan to use to achieve that. They’ll tell you if that’s possible, or if you’ll have to do more to achieve your goal. Wide reaching or particularly powerful effects might require a unique material to hold the rune, or for the rune to be duplicated in multiple places.

#### Elements

* **Air:** breath, wind
* **Fire:** burning, heat
* **Earth:** solidity, weight
* **Water:** liquid, change

#### Verbs

* **Enhance:** addition, amplification
* **Impair:** reduction, suppression
* **Move:** motive force, relocation
* **Create:** production, renewal
* **Destroy:** removal, decay

#### Subjects

* **Self:** the element itself
* **Object:** an inanimate object
* **Creature:** a living thing

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Expansive Research:** Learn the remaining Elements, Verbs and Subjects from the standard lists.
* **Rune Logic:** You’ve learned to add Modifiers as a fourth component of a rune:
    * **If:** Set a condition under which an empowered run will activate.
    * **Not:** Invert the effects of the Verb or Element used in a rune.
* **Synergistic Conjunctions:** You’ve learned the And component which lets you write runes that incorporate two Elements, two Verbs, or two Subjects.
* **Esoteric Elements:** You’ve learned to manipulate the following two elements in your runes:
    * **Time:** dealing with speeding or slowing things.
    * **Space:** dealing with locations and distances.

## Sneaky Bastard

*You’ve always been up to something. When people look one way, you’re going the other. There’s always at least one more ace up your sleeve. Of course all this has a tendency to ruffle feathers, so it’s a good thing you’ve got the perfect partner to watch your back… yourself.*

### Core Ability

**Self Cloning Technique:** You have the ability to split apart or create copies of yourself. Choose the style of cloning you use:

* **Split Self**, divide your physical self in two.
* **Shadow Clone**, you and your shadow can act dependently.
* **Illusory**, create images of yourself.

### You Start With

* Daggers (d6), you always manage to have another one secreted about your person.
* Ring of 6 Bump Keys, roll a d6 to open a lock: (1: the lock and key break, 2-3: the lock or key breaks, 4-6: nothing breaks).
* A Dramatic Looking Cloak

### Self Cloning Technique

* **Split Self:** Divide yourself in two. Your split starts with your Grit and a d4 in all Attributes. You may step down your own Attributes to step up the corresponding Attribute of your clone. If either half dies the missing Attributes are lost, although you may heal back to your maximums as usual. You are both halves of yourself at all times and you both have access to your inventory, although only one half may use a specific item at any given time.
* **Shadow Clone:** You can separate your shadow from your physical self. Your shadow is insubstantial and immaterial, but cannot pass through opaque objects. It is immune to physical damage, but vulnerable to magic and bright lights. Your shadow can hide in the shadow of another creature, and while there you can read their surface thoughts, and communicate to them mentally.
* **Illusory:** Create a number of illusory clones up to the number of advanced abilities you have. Your clones are insubstantial and intangible but are otherwise indistinguishable from your real self. You do not have to declare which of you is real until it matters, and you share the senses of all clones simultaneously. When attacking with clones if you would deal Direct Damage you must either declare the clone is actually you or reveal it as an illusion.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Multifarious Copies:** When you create your clone you may freely change its physical appearance.
* **For He Can Creep:** Your footsteps make no sound, and you are impossible to see by mundane means while you are motionless in shadow. You may extend this effect to anyone you choose within 10 feet of you.
* **Snap:** Recall your clone to yourself, or yourself to your clone from any distance. Anyone touching you while you do so is carried along.
* **Pick Pocket:** While a creature is totally unaware of your presence (discounting clones) you may swap an object they carry with an object of similar size and heft.

## Soulbearer

*The soul of a great beast lives within you, granting you its skills and form. Shamanic ritual prepares for such a transfer, layering soul upon soul for generations until an animal is ready to make a Soulbearer.*

### Core Ability

**Great Soul:** An unusually dense and powerful soul from some animal has been ritualistically implanted into you. This grants you some measure of that animal’s skills as well as the ability to freely transform into it.

### You Start With

* **Your Great Soul**
* A beneficial quirk and an inconvenient instinct from your Great Soul

### Your Great Soul

Choose the animal whose Great Soul lives within you and pick three abilities from the [Animal’s Companion list](#animals-companion-1). When you transform into your animal form those abilities modify your existing stats.

Grit and Ability loss is maintained between your forms (you won’t magically heal by transforming).

While not in animal form one beneficial quirk bleeds through. For example perfect balance for a cat’s soul, or excellent eyesight from an eagle’s. One inconvenient instinct also remains to get you into trouble.

Your Great Soul allows you to speak to and understand the animal whose soul you share. 

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Soul Sight:** Temporarily blind yourself to the material world to see creature’s souls. You can see, through all but the most powerful of illusions, what sort of creature they are as well as their current mood.
* **Spiritual Resistance:** Your Great Soul gives you a spiritual density and fullness that makes it difficult for outside forces to influence you. You are immune to charm, sleep, fear, mind control, and other similar supernatural effects. 
* **Speaker to the Dead:** You can consult with the lingering souls and spirits of those who died nearby. Recalcitrant spirits may require offerings or favors before being willing to assist.
* **Psychopomp:** When you are attendant to the death of a creature (whether caused by you or not) you may take temporary custody of its soul. You can use your Great Soul ability to take that creature’s form once, but afterwards the soul passes beyond the Black River.

## Witch

*Familiar at your side, you channel the forces of magic across the mystic bond that connects you. You are a shepherd to ancient secrets, passed from person to person to keep them safe from forces who would rather see it lost.*

### Core Ability

**Familiar Bond:** You have magically bonded to a small creature. This bond allows you to channel magic through the Familiar, letting it cast spells for you. 

### You Start With

* **Your Familiar**
* A Grimoire (bulky), containing two spells and one ritual of your choice.
* A Fanciful Hat or Ornamentation

### Your Familiar

Create your Familiar by combining two options from the [Animal’s Companion Ability list]((#animals-companion-1)) with these base stats:

1 Grit, a d4 attack, d4 STR, d4 DEX, and d4 WIL

(A bird or other flying Familiar requires you to choose the Flying Ability from that list)

Casting a spell through your Familiar works the same as you casting a spell, except the Familiar pays the costs: its Grit is set to zero, or it must make a WIL Save. You can have your Familiar concentrate on a spell cast through it to maintain it, and remain deprived, in your place. This allows you to keep two spells maintained simultaneously.

So long as you are alive, your Familiar Bond prevents your Familiar from being permanently destroyed. If killed you can always re-summon your Familiar through an hour long ritual unique to you.

### Advanced Abilities

Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have (0 XP → 2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP).

* **Wild Spellcapture:** You know the ancient secrets of binding wild magic into spells and rituals. By disintegrating your familiar into raw magic while it interacts with a natural magical phenomenon, your Familiar Bond creates a direct link to the magic allowing you to bind it into your Grimoire (you'll have to re-summon your Familiar afterwards). Work with the GM to determine the details of the spell or ritual you create.
* **Familiar Sights:** You can borrow the senses of your familiar and guide them remotely.
* **Unfamiliar Familiar:** Each time you re-summon your Familiar you can choose a new form for it to take (adjusting the Animal’s Companion options as needed).
* **Witch Steed:** In your hands a broom, cauldron, or other household object becomes a flying steed.
