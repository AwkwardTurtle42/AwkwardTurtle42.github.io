## Soulbearer

*The soul of a great beast lives within you, granting you its skills and form. Shamanic ritual prepares for such a transfer, layering soul upon soul for generations until an animal is ready to make a Soulbearer.*

### Core Ability

**Great Soul:** An unusually dense and powerful soul from some animal has been ritualistically implanted into you. This grants you some measure of that animal’s skills as well as the ability to freely transform into it.

### You Start With

* **Your Great Soul**
* A beneficial quirk and an inconvenient instinct from your Great Soul

### Your Great Soul

Choose the animal whose Great Soul lives within you and pick three abilities from the [Animal’s Companion list](#animal-companion-abilities). When you transform into your animal form those abilities modify your existing stats.

Grit and Ability loss is maintained between your forms (you won’t magically heal by transforming).

While not in animal form one beneficial quirk bleeds through. For example perfect balance for a cat’s soul, or excellent eyesight from an eagle’s. One inconvenient instinct also remains to get you into trouble.

Your Great Soul allows you to speak to and understand the animal whose soul you share. 

### Advanced Abilities

Spend 2 XP to unlock your first Advanced Ability. Each subsequent Advanced Ability's cost increases by two. (2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP → 8 XP).

* **Soul Sight:** Temporarily blind yourself to the material world to see souls. Based on a soul, you can tell what sort of creature they are as well as their current mood. Your sight pierces most illusions, but is blocked by mundane materials such as stone or earth.
* **Spiritual Resistance:** Your Great Soul gives you a spiritual density and fullness that makes it difficult for outside forces to influence you. You are immune to charm, sleep, fear, mind control, and other similar supernatural effects. 
* **Speaker to the Dead:** You can consult with the lingering souls and spirits of those who died nearby. Recalcitrant spirits may require offerings or favors before being willing to assist.
* **Psychopomp:** When you are attendant to the death of a creature (whether caused by you or not) you may take temporary custody of its soul. You can use your Great Soul ability to take that creature’s form once, but afterwards the soul passes beyond the Black River.

## Witch

*Familiar at your side, you channel the forces of magic across the mystic bond that connects you. You are a shepherd to ancient secrets, passed from person to person to keep them safe from forces who would rather see it lost.*

### Core Ability

**Familiar Bond:** You have magically bonded to a small creature. This bond allows you to channel magic through the Familiar, letting it cast spells for you. 

### You Start With

* **Your Familiar**
* A Grimoire (bulky), containing two spells and one ritual of your choice.
* A Fanciful Hat or Ornamentation

### Your Familiar

Create your Familiar by combining two options from the [Animal’s Companion Ability list](#animal-companion-abilities) with these base stats:

1 Grit, a d4 attack, d4 STR, d4 DEX, and d4 WIL

(A bird or other flying Familiar requires you to choose the Flying Ability from that list)

Casting a spell through your Familiar works the same as you casting a spell, except the Familiar pays the costs: its Grit is set to zero, or it must make a WIL Save. You can have your Familiar concentrate on a spell cast through it to maintain it, and remain deprived, in your place. This allows you to keep two spells maintained simultaneously.

So long as you are alive, your Familiar Bond prevents your Familiar from being permanently destroyed. If killed you can always re-summon your Familiar through an hour long ritual unique to you.

### Advanced Abilities

Spend 2 XP to unlock your first Advanced Ability. Each subsequent Advanced Ability's cost increases by two. (2 XP → 4 XP → 6 XP → 8 XP).

* **Wild Spellcapture:** You know the ancient secrets of binding wild magic into spells and rituals. By disintegrating your familiar into raw magic while it interacts with a natural magical phenomenon, your Familiar Bond creates a direct link to the magic allowing you to bind it into your Grimoire (you'll have to re-summon your Familiar afterwards). Work with the GM to determine the details of the spell or ritual you create.
* **Familiar Sights:** You can borrow the senses of your familiar and guide them remotely.
* **Unfamiliar Familiar:** Each time you re-summon your Familiar you can choose a new form for it to take (adjusting the Animal’s Companion options as needed).
* **Witch Steed:** In your hands a broom, cauldron, or other household object becomes a flying steed.
