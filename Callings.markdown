# Callings
## Archivist
You’ve always liked knowing things. Collecting information and stories like a squirrel collecting nuts for the winter. Frustrated with incomplete, inconsistent, and obviously biased records you’ve emerged from your study to do first hand research and correct the record.
### Core Ability
**Expert Reader:** No matter the language, culture, code, cypher, or style you can always quickly discern the intent and meaning of any written language.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * Your Archive (bulky): Starts with one Topic of information based on your prior studies. 
 * Wire Rimmed Reading Glasses
 * Knife-Pen (d6) and Ink

### Your Archive
Your Archive acts as a Grimoire, and can store spells and rituals in addition to storing your knowledge.
The first time you encounter something that falls within a Topic recorded in your Archive, you may ask the GM a single question about it. Further questions will take time to look up, or require further research. It takes six hours to record a new Topic of information into your Archive from any source of knowledge.
### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Office Assistant:** Whether due to accumulated knowledge or through some arcane rite, your Archive has awoken into a sentient, floating being. Casting spells still requires you to hold the Archive to read from it.
 * **Monster Manual:** Thoroughly examine a creature to record it as a Topic in your Archive. When you take the time to lecture from your notes, you and any who listen gain +1 armor against a recorded creature during the next combat.
 * **Psychometry:** You can read an object’s history just by touching it. When you handle an object you can sense events that have happened to it. Emotionally charged and recent events take precedence, but with careful study you may ask specific questions.
 * **Leap of Logic:** Your years of study have developed into a startlingly accurate intuition. When you closely examine a situation (or person), you may ask the GM a single yes or no question about it (or them).

## Demonic Sorcerer
A spirit of chaos, better known as a demon, has made its home in your head. In exchange for the shelter your body provides, it grants you access to the knowledge and skills its picked up from prior hosts. Sometime, when you die, it will leap to a new body and pass along the skills and knowledge it learned from you, but you might prefer not to think about that.
### Core Ability
**Demonic Passenger:** You have a demon in your brain which acts as a hands free Grimoire, a magical tutor, and a repository of ancient knowledge.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * **The Demon In Your Brain:** It knows one random spell and one random ritual, as well as one spell and one ritual of your choice.
 * An Unusual Choice of Clothing: Your Demon insists on it.

### Your Demon
You have a spirit of chaos living within your brain. As a being of pure spirit it cannot exist or interact with the material world on its own, and requires your body to do either.
**Magical Storage:** Your Demon stores spells and rituals as though it were a Grimoire. “Copying” new spells or rituals into it still removes them from the source as usual.
Anytime you spend XP, your Demon recalls a random spell or ritual (your choice) from a prior host.
**Hands Free Spellcasting:** Using your Demon’s power you can cast spells while keeping your hands free for other activities. The effort of doing so still requires that you set your Grit to 0 or a make WIL Save as usual.
Inherited Knowledge: Choose a Topic based on your Demon’s prior host. You may ask questions about that Topic as per the Archivist’s Archive.
### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Demonic Sight:** Your Demon has learned to share its sprititual senses with you, allowing you to sense the presence and nature of nearby magical or supernatural energies.
 * **Backseat Driver:** If you are ever knocked unconscious or have your mind imparied in any way, you can choose to have your Demon take over and control your body instead.
 * **Primal Chaos:** You can release the raw, chaotic energies of your Demon as a d8 ranged attack.
 * **Demonic Expression:** Ongoing exposure to otherworldly energies has induced a unique mutation. For example: a demonic eye that sees true names, a scaled arm that steals secrets, or a translucent skin that let's you sink into shadows.

## Alchemist
Through branch and root you know how to unlock the secrets of the earth. You use this knowledge to wrench the very world to will.
### Core Ability
**Branch and Bone:** You can distill plants, minerals, animal parts, and other ingredients into potion components. With the necessary components, you can brew doses of any potion whose recipe you know.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * **Recipe Book:** (bulky) Acts as a Grimoire that also stores your potion recipes. Contains two potion recipes.
 * Mortar (1d6) and Pestle
 * Potion Bandoleer: Contains one vial each of your starting potion recipes.
### Potion Recipies
A potion recipe must contain at least two dissimilar components along with a brewing process. Any potion effect is possible, but the required components and process may be esoteric or prohibitive.
To create a new potion recipe, explain the desired effects along with the proposed recipe.
The GM will tell you if it will work, or if one or more more of the following are true:
 * It will require one or more additional components.
 * It requires a laborious, time consuming, or difficult to achieve brewing process.
 * It takes a large amount of raw materials to produce a single dose.
 * It creates an unstable, volatile potion that must be used quickly or lose its efficacy.
 * The process is uncertain, and the final effect will depend on a random roll.
 * It will have an unintended side effect when consumed.

### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Alchemic Distillation:** You can distill the Spells and Rituals in your Recipe Book into potions that can be released by drinking, pouring, or throwing. Spells can be distilled quickly, where rituals take as long to distill as they would to perform. Magic distilled in this way is removed from your Recipe Book until released.
 * **Fine Palate:** You are (optionally) immune to the effects of anything you imbibe, and can identify all ingredients it contains.
 * **Homebrewer:** You can brew alcoholic beverages with mild potion effects. Beverage recipes require only one component plus a fermentable (grain, fruit, sugar, etc.).
 * **Topical Treatment:** You can produce potions that are applied in ways other than drinking, such as breathable fumes, topical ointments, or smeared onto weapons.

## Artificer
Your habit of always taking things apart to learn how they worked didn’t always endear you to people. When you started putting things back together people were mollified. Once they realized the things you’d put back together were better than before? That’s when you got popular.
### Core Ability
**Walking Workshop:** You can upgrade mundane objects or create new ones with a single improvement. They are *fragile*, unless significant time and effort is put into their production.
When a *fragile* item is used, roll a d6 (for weapons and armor roll on Direct Damage):

2-3: It’s damaged, and will break next time.
4-6: It’s fine for now.

 * **Mystical Graft:** You can graft enchantments and effects from magic items, weapons or armor onto something else. This destroys the original item.
 * **An Eye for Engineering:** With careful study you can always discern the purpose and function of a mechanism, as well as the best way to break or repair it.
 * **Efficient Artificing:** You can use Walking Workshop to create volatile objects with two improvements, or non-volatile ones with one improvement.
 * **Mule:** You can carry up to four bulky things without penalty.

## Devoted
You are devoted to something larger than yourself. It might be a deity, an organization, or simply an ideal. Whatever it is, your devotion to it grants you strength beyond mortal ken. Whether it is power granted to you, or pulled from within, your devotion guides your actions.
### Core Ability
**Devoted Oath:** Choose a **vow** you must live by, and two **boons** your devotion grants you. If you break your vow, you lose your boons for a year and a day or until you make amends.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit

 * **Observance:** You must complete a ritual or task (something inconvenient) in each location you visit.
### Boons

 * **Unsullied Truth:** You always know if someone is lying, or if something is hidden by illusion or glamour in your presence.
 * **Can’t Stop Won’t Stop:** You are never *incapacitated* by Direct Damage, even when you fail your Save, unless it kills you.
 * **Weapon of Faith:** Choose an improvement from the Artificer’s Improvement list. Weapons you hold gain that Improvement.
 * **Healing Touch:** With a night’s focus restore one step of Attribute loss. Or make a WIL Save: Win: Immediately stabilize the wound and restore one step of Attribute loss. Lose: The wound is mirrored onto you. Tie: Both. 
 * **Minor Miracle:** You have the ability to perform a minor miracle related to your devotion.

### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Doubly Devoted:** Take a second Vow, and gain a second Boon.
 * **Living Legend:** Word of your deeds always spreads far and wide. Tick an unticked entry in your Eulogy to force a strong reaction from an NPC: pick two from Fear, Hate, Respect, and Adoration. The GM will pick one of those two to be true.

 * **Always Prepared:** You carry a bag which can be opened at any time to reveal a useful, mundane item of your choice. You can do so again once you’ve been somewhere you could have restocked it.

## Blessed of Water
Were you granted a boon by an ocean goddess? Are you the daughter of a river spirit? Perhaps you did some great deed for the guardian of a particular cove? Your watery patron granted you a part of itself and bound you to water. They are not a dominant presence in your journey, but their support is constant and you hear their voice in the patter of rain, the burble of a creek, or the crash of ocean waves.
### Core Ability
**A Thing of the Sea:** You are equally at home in water as you are on land. You can freely control a volume of water about the same size as yourself, if employed as a weapon it deals d6 damage.
Name your Patron (the spirit, body, or source of water that has claimed you), and choose the blessing it grants.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * A waterskin
 * A small, impossible token from your Patron

### Water Blessing
Choose the blessing your Patron grants you:
 * **Fluid Form:** Freely turn into water and back to your normal state.

## Animal's Companion
Ranger, beastmaster, wildspeaker, hunter… the labels don’t matter, what’s important is that your companion is by your side. Your bond extends to the ends of the world and beyond.
### Core Ability
**Animal Companion:** You have formed a special bond with a creature. It will follow your commands and is unfailingly loyal. Should the worst happen, your companion will return to your side from beyond the Black River as a ghost.
You can spend your own XP on your companion as you would on yourself.
Your companion starts with:
1 Grit, a d6 attack, d6 STR, d6 DEX, and d6 WIL
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * **Your Companion**
 * A Bag of Beast Snacks (whatever your companion prefers)

### Advanced Abilities

## Witch
Familiar at your side, you channel the forces of magic across the mystic bond that connects you. You are a shepherd to ancient secrets, passed from person to person to keep them safe from forces who would rather see it lost.
### Core Ability
**Familiar Bond:** You have magically bonded to a small creature. This bond allows you to channel magic through the Familiar, letting it cast spells for you.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * **Your Familiar**
 * A Grimoire (bulky), containing two
spells and one ritual of your choice.
 * A Fanciful Hat or Ornamentation

### Your Familiar
Your Familiar is a creature with 1 Grit, a d4 attack, d4 STR, d4 DEX, and d4 WIL. Choose two options from the Animal’s Companion Ability list to improve your Familiar.
Casting a spell through your Familiar works the same as you casting a spell, except the Familiar pays the costs: it’s Grit is set to zero, or it must make a WIL Save. You must still be holding your Grimoire as usual while casting the spell.
So long as you are alive, your Familiar Bond prevents your Familiar from being permanently killed. You can always resummon your Familiar through an hour long ritual unique to you.
### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Witch’s Curse:** Make eye contact with a character and pronounce doom against them. Make a WIL Save vs their WIL: Success: Bad fortune befalls them immediately. Tie: Soon. Fail: Eventually. If you take time to make a proper curse (with a rhyming incantation and rare ingredients) you can create a lasting effect, although there must always be a way to break it.
 * **Familiar Sights:** You can borrow the senses of your familiar and guide them remotely.
 * **Unfamiliar Familiar:** Each time you resummon your Familiar you can choose a new animal form for it to take (adjusting the Animal’s Companion options as needed).
 * **Witch Steed:** In your hands a broom, cauldron, or other household object becomes a flying steed.

## Grimblade
You are a grimblade and you have a grimblade, a unique and very large weapon that you’ve learned the trick of putting spells into. Whether you physically inscribe it onto a meteor metal blade, or embed the spells into a crystal hammer, you find this eminently more practical than lugging a big book around.
### Core Ability
**Grimblade:** You have a mystical weapon capable of storing spells and rituals as thorugh it were a Grimoire. It is any type of melee weapon, made of some unusual material. Your Grimblade is indestructible and you always know where it is.
### You Start With
 * 3 Grit
 * **Your Grimblade:** (d10, bulky),containing 2 spells of your choice.
 * Unusual Armor (1 Armor)

### Grimblade
Your Grimblade acts as a Grimoire and can store spells and rituals with in. This could take the form of engraving arcane words onto the flat of a great two handed blade, embedding mystic energy into the crystalline head of a massive hammer, or simply bashing people about the head with a very large book.
You cast spells and rituals from it as usual, but if you cast a spell while at zero Grit you roll the Save with your STR rather than your WIL.
**Kinetic Spellcasting:** If you deal Direct Damage with your Grimblade you may immediately cast a spell ignoring the usual costs. You do not set your Grit to zero or make a Save. This works only for spells and cannot be used to perform rituals.
### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Mystic Strike:** Drop your Grit to zero to deal max damage on an attack. You can only do this if you’re not already at zero Grit.
 * **Spell Disruption:** You can destroy weak (and disrupt powerful) ongoing spells and enchantments with your Grimblade. If there is risk of magical backlash, make a STR Save to avoid it.
 * **Hammerspace:** You can store your Grimblade in a sub dimensional space (a Mary Poppins bag, a small portal, a tattoo, etc.) where it can be retrieved instantly.
 * **I, Grimblade:** Whether through the magic stored within it or from some other means, your Grimblade has become sentient and ambulatory. It can float, act, and attack on its own.

## Great Soul Shaman
The soul of a great beast lives within you, granting you it’s skills and form. Shamanic ritual prepares for such a transfer, layering soul upon soul for generations until an animal is ready to make a Shaman.
### Core Ability
**Great Soul:** An unusually dense and powerful soul from some animal has been ritualistically implanted into you. This grants you some measure of that animal’s skills as well as the ability to freely transform into it.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * **Your Great Soul**
 * Melee Weapon (d6)
 * Ranged Weapon (d8, bulky)
 * A beneficial quirk and an inconvenient instinct from your Great Soul

### Your Great Soul
Choose the animal whose Great Soul lives within you and pick three abilities from the Animal’s Companion list. When you transform into your animal form those abilities modify your existing stats.
Grit and ability loss is maintained between your forms (you won’t magically heal by transforming).
While not in animal form one beneficial quirk bleeds through. For example perfect balance for a cat’s soul, or excellent eyesight from an eagle’s.
Your Great Soul allows you to speak to and understand the animal whose soul you share.
### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Soul Sight:** You can blind yourself to the material world to see creature’s souls. You can see, through all but the most powerful of illusions, what sort of creature they are and their mood.
 * **Spiritual Resistance:** Your Great Soul gives you a spiritual density and fullness that makes it difficult for outside forces to influence you. You are immune to charm, sleep, fear, mind control, and other similar supernatural effects.
 * **Speaker to the Dead:** You can consult with the lingering souls and spirits of those who died nearby. Recalcitrant spirits may require offerings or favors before being willing to assist.
 * **Psychopomp:** When you are attendant to the death of a creature (caused by you or not) you may temporarily take custody of its soul. You can use your Great Soul ability to take that creature’s form once, but afterwards the soul passes beyond the Black River.

## Cleric of Small Gods
You carry a small god around with you. You protect it, rather than the other way around. Possibly a baby god, a god of a small concept, a recently reincarnated god, a local god whose home was destroyed, or a ‘killed’ god. Regardless you are bound to it, and may speak with its words to alter the world around you.
### Core Ability
Words of God: Gods can speak only truth. When you speak with the words of your god if the words are not true, your god’s power will attempt to make it true.
Define the Domain of your god.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * Your Small God
 * A ceremonial object (d6)
 * A d8 Domain Die

### Words of God
When you attempt to make something true by speaking with the words of your god, you risk the universe rejecting your statement. Adjust your Domain Die based on your intended outcome. If the Die would step below a d4 the statement is impossible, if it would step above a d12 it happens without a roll. Otherwise, roll it as a normal Save:
**Win:** The statement takes effect.
**Tie:** Making the statement true saps your god’s power, your Domain die steps down.
**Lose:** The statement fails and your Domain die steps down.
Domain Die loss is restored through offerings or religious rites for your God.
Step down your Domain Die if the statement:
 * Impacts things outside of your line of sight.
 * Directly contradicts the natural working of the world.
 * Describes a long lasting effect (step up twice if permanent).
 * Is a poor fit for your god’s Domain.
Step up your Domain Die if the statement:
 * Impacts only things you are touching.
 * Is copacetic with the natural working of the world.
 * Describes a fleeting effect.
 * Is a perfect fit for your god’s Domain.
### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Gemini:** Your god has a second Domain, complementary in some way to the first.
 * **Holy Site:** Spend a week and give a suitably impressive offering to create a holy site for your god. It shields those within from outside influence, and you may teleport yourself and your companions to between holy sites.
 * **Offerings:** Make offerings to step up the Domain Die. Minor offerings last for a single statement, significant ones last for a day, and major offerings like establishing a church and congregation last indefinitely.
 * **Divine Colleagues:** Your god can always tell you which (if any) god or spirit claims an area, as well as how to contact them.

## Runewright
You are a runewright, you imbue and channel power through engraved symbols of power. You are no wizard. You’re above running around shooting crude magic from your fingertips, blasting things with fireballs. Runes are sophisticated. Runes are subtler, slower, and longer lasting than spells. Anyone can pick up a spellbook and cast a spell, crafting runes takes refinement. And you are refined.
### Core Ability
**Runic Magic:** You can inscribe runes that incorporate one Element, one Verb, and one Subject. Empower and activate an inscribed rune with a drop of fresh drop of your blood and a point of Max Grit. You can deactivate a rune at will to recover the spent Max Grit.
### You Start With
 * 4 Grit
 * Knowledge of 2 Elements, 2 Verbs, and 2 Subjects
 * Hammer (d6) and Chisel (d6)
 * Flawless handwriting

### Rune Components
Runic magic is subtler than both Spells and Rituals, dealing mostly with modifying existing things. The effects are long lasting, but generally less powerful.
When you inscribe a rune, tell the GM what your intended effect is and what components you plan to use to achieve that. They’ll tell you if that’s possible, or if you’ll have to do more to achieve your goal.
#### Elements
**Air:** breath, wind
**Fire:** burning, heat
**Earth:** solidity, weight
**Water:** liquid, change
#### Verbs
**Enhance:** addition, amplification
**Impair:** reduction, suppression
**Move:** motive force, relocation
**Create:** production, renewal
**Destroy:** removal, decay
#### Subjects
**Self:** the element itself
**Object:** an inanimate object
**Creature:** a living thing
### Advanced Abilities
Pick one Advanced Ability at character creation. Gain more by spending XP equal to twice the number of Advanced Abilities you currently have.
 * **Expansive Research:** Learn the remaining Elements, Verbs and Subjects from the standard lists.
 * **Rune Logic:** You’ve learned to add Modifiers as a fourth component of a rune:
   * **If:** Set a condition under which an empowered run will activate.
   * **Not:** Invert the effects of the Verb or Element used in a rune.
 * **Synergistic Conjunctions:** You’ve learned to write runes that incorporate two Elements simultaneously.
 * **Esoteric Elements:** You’ve learned to manipulate the following two elements in your runes:
   * **Time:** dealing with speeding or slowing things
   * **Space:** dealing with locations and distances
