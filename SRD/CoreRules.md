# Core Rules

## Attributes

Characters have three Attributes represented by dice ranging in size from d4 to d12. 

**Strength (STR):** Represents physical power, toughness, and endurance.

**Dexterity (DEX):** Represents speed, reflexes, and precision.

**Willpower (WIL):** Represents focus, alacrity, and concentration.

A d4 is weak, d6 is average, d8 is noteworthy, d10 is strong and d12 is legendary.

## Grit

Grit is a character’s mental concentration and ability to avoid harm. Grit is lost when being attacked, performing complex tasks like casting Spells, or attempting to carrying too much. It is not a measure of  physical health, and and lost Grit is restored quickly.

## Dice

Dice range in size from d4 to d12. If an effect tells you to step a die up or down, move it right or left along this track:

d4 ↔ d6 ↔ d8 ↔ d10 ↔ d12

Dice cannot be larger than a d12, and a die stepped down below a d4 is at zero.


## Saves

When you want to do something, describe how you go about it and the GM will tell you if it’s possible and inform you of any obvious consequences of your action.

If the action is risky and carries potential consequences, you’ll make a Save by rolling your appropriate Attribute die to avoid them. 

If you roll a 4 or higher you successfully avoid the consequences. If you fail, by rolling a 1-3, you suffer the consequences.

When you’re directly opposed by another character or creature, you’ll roll against them instead.

 * If you roll higher than your opponent you win and avoid the consequences.
 * If you roll lower you lose.
 * If your rolls are equal you tie and are forced into a compromise or tough choice.

If you have to make a Save with an Attribute whose die is below a d4 (at zero), you automatically fail.


## Save Modifiers

If you’re in a good position, but something could still go wrong, your Save is *enhanced* and you roll a d12 in addition to your Attribute die, then keep whichever is higher.

If you’re in a rough position, but you still have a chance to avoid the consequences, your Save is *impaired* and you’ll roll a d4 instead of your Attribute die.
