# Items & Inventory

## Bulky Items

You can carry as much as makes sense in your inventory without tracking it. However, if you are carrying more than two *bulky* items you have zero Grit are deprived.

*Bulky* items are heavy or awkwardly sized, requiring two hands to hold.

## Armor

Armor (i.e. 1 Armor) subtracts its score from the result of damage rolls against you. Items, such as shields, that grant bonus armor only apply while the item is held (i.e. +1 Armor).
You cannot have more than Armor 3 in total.

Single pieces of armor that grants 2 Armor are rare, and usually carry some sort of drawback or limitation.

## Ammo

Ammunition (arrows, bolts, bullets, etc.) are generally not tracked and considered to be unlimited, unless specific circumstances would lead to it being in short supply.
Unique or specialty ammo is tracked individually where appropriate.

## Wilderness Survival

This is an optional mechanic to add pressure to return to civilization or to focus the game on survival during long trips through the wilderness. It will make deciding what to carry and how many Supplies to bring a focal point of the game. 

Supplies (*bulky*) can be purchased in most settlements and cities, and are an abstraction of food, water, and general survival equipment. A single *bulky* unit of Supplies supports the entire party for a full day.

Once a day while away from easy access to food and water, the party picks someone to lead the survival efforts. That person makes a Save with an Attribute based on their approach (fishing, hunting, scavenging, etc.).

Succeed and you find enough resources to feed the party. Fail and the party must consume Supplies to avoid deprivation.

This Save can be *enhanced* or *impaired* as usual based on the hospitality (or lack thereof) of the environment or weather conditions.
