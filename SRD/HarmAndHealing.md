# Harm & Healing

## Atribute Damage

By default all Direct Damage is dealt to STR. In some circumstances mystical energies or psychic horror might deal Direct Damage to WIL, whereas attacks that seek to entangle or slow might deal Direct Damage to DEX.

In these circumstances make a Direct Damage Save as usual, but using the affected Attribute rather than STR.

## Attribute Loss

Injury is represented by Attribute dice being stepped won from their Maximum size.

Dropping to zero dice in any Attribute means risking serious and lasting consequences.

Taking Direct Damage to an Attribute at zero dice, or trying to step it down, means:

**Death** for STR.

**Paralysis** for DEX.

**Catatonia** for WIL.

In all cases (but particularly death) these are not conditions that can be easily rectified by simply catching your breath. Medical or magical expertise is required to be treated.

## Catching Your Breath

When you have a few minutes to catch your breath and drink some water, you restore all of your Grit back to its maximum. Doing so in a dungeon or hazardous environment may expose the party to danger.

## Attribute Recovery

A night’s rest accompanied by food, warmth, and shelter recovers one step of Attribute loss from the single Attribute.

A full day’s rest in comfort completely restores a single Attribute to it’s maximum.

## Deprivation

If you are without vital needs for a full day (food, water, rest) you are *deprived* and cannot regain Grit or Attributes.

Concentrating on a spell to maintain its effect also causes *deprivation* until it is ended.
