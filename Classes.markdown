## Artificer

_Your habit of always taking things apart to learn how they worked didn’t always endear you to people. When you started putting things back together people were mollified. Once they realized the things you’d put back together were better than before? That’s when you got popular._


### Core Ability

Walking Workshop: You can upgrade mundane items, or create new objects, with a single _improvement_ using your Portable Workshop. All such objects are _volatile_, unless significant time and effort is put into their production.

When a _volatile _item is used, roll a d6 (usage counts as dealing Critical Damage for weapon, receiving Critical Damage for armor, or performing their purpose for items).

1: It breaks immediately (and likely violently).

2-3: It’s noticeably damaged, and will break after its next use.

4-6: It’s fine for now. 


### You Start With



*   2 Grit
*   Your Masterwork Artifacts - One of each Weapon, Armor and Item with 3 Improvements distributed amongst them. When upgraded with _volatile_ improvements your Masterwork Artifacts can always be repaired to their original state.
*   Your Artificing Tools

*   Mule - You can carry up to four _bulky_ things without penalty. 

## Devoted

_You are devoted to something larger than yourself. It might be a deity, an organization, or simply an ideal. Whatever it is, your devotion to it grants you strength beyond mortal ken. Whether it is power granted to you, or pulled from within, your devotion guides your actions._


### Core Ability

*   Living Legend: Word of your deeds always manages to spread far and wide. Tick an unticked entry in your Eulogy to force a strong reaction from an NPC: pick two of Fear, Hate, Respect, Adoration and the GM will pick one of those two to be true.

## Beastmaster

### Core Ability

Animal Companion: You have formed a special bond with a creature. It will follow your commands and is unfailingly loyal. Should the worst happen, your companion will return to your side from beyond the Black RIver as a ghost (it’s ethereal, non-magical damage it deals or is dealt is _imparied_).

## Chaos Sorcerer

_A spirit of chaos, better known as a demon, shares space in your head. In exchange for the shelter your body provides, it grants you access to it’s knowledge and skills picked up from prior hosts. Sometime, when you die, it will leap to a new body and share _your_ skills and knowledge, but you might prefer not to think about that._

*   Backseat Driver: If you are ever knocked unconscious or have your mind imparied in any way, you can choose to have your Demon take over and control your body instead.


## Witch

_Familiar at your side, you channel the forces of magic across the magical bond that connects you. You are a shepherd to ancient secrets, passed from person to person to keep them safe from forces who would rather see it lost. _


### Core Ability

Familiar Bond: You have magically bonded to a small creature. This bond allows you to channel magic through the Familiar, letting it cast spells for you. Familiars explode, pop, evaporate, or die in some other way if their WIL steps below a d4. Familiars can be resummoned in an hour long ritual.


### You Start With:



*   3 Grit
*   A Grimoire (_bulky_), containing two spells and one ritual of your choice.

*   Familiar Sights: You can borrow the senses of your familiar and guide them remotely.
*   Unfamiliar Familiar: Each time you resummon your Familiar you can choose a new animal form for it to take (adjusting the Animal Companion options as needed).

## Alchemist

_Through branch and root you know how to unlock the secrets of the earth. You use this knowledge to wrench the very world to will._


### Core Ability

Branch and Bone: You can distill plants, minerals, animal parts, and other ingredients into potion components. With the necessary components, you can brew doses of any potion whose recipe you know.


### You Start With



*   Best of 2d6 Grit
*   Recipe Book (_bulky_) - Acts as a Grimoire that can also store your potion recipes. Contains two potion recipes (work with the GM).
*   Potion Making Equipment: mortar and pestle, assorted glassware, etc.
*   A Potion Bandolier - Contains one vial each of your starting potion recipes.


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Alchemic Distillation: You can distill the Spells and Rituals in your Recipe Book into potions. Distilling rituals still requires any components the ritual itself does. Once distilled, “cast” the potion by drinking, pouring, or throwing it (ignore the usual costs).
*   Homebrewer: You can brew beverages the same way you can brew potions, except they only take one potion component alongside a fermentable (grain, fruit, sugar, etc.). Your beverages produce more mild effects than potions, but you can create large batches at once.
*   Topical Treatment: You can produce potions that can be applied in ways other than drinking, such as breathable fumes, topical ointments, or smeared onto weapons.
*   Fine Palate: You are immune (unless you choose otherwise) to the effects of anything you imbibe, and can identify all ingredients it contains.


### Potion Recipes

A potion recipe must contain at least two dissimilar components along with some brewing requirement. Any potion effect is possible, but the required components and process may be esoteric or prohibitive. To create a new potion recipe, explain the desired effects along with the proposed recipe, the GM will tell you if it could work, or if one or more more of the following are true:



*   It will require one or more additional components.
*   It requires a laborious, time consuming, or difficult to achieve brewing step.
*   It takes a large amount of raw materials to produce a single dose.
*   It creates an unstable, volatile potion that must be used quickly or lose its efficacy.
*   The process is uncertain, and the final effect will depend on a random roll.
*   It will have an unintended side effect when consumed.


## Great Soul Shaman

_The soul of a great beast lives within you, granting you it’s skills and form. Shamanic ritual prepares for such a transfer, layering soul upon soul of generations of the animal until it is ready to make a Shaman._


### Core Ability

Great Soul: Choose the animal whose soul lives within you. You may transform into that animal (with a WIL Save if doing it quickly). You retain your own Grit and can rearrange your Attributes to suit the animal. You gain whatever strengths and weaknesses that animal has, including attacks, armor, locomotion, and senses. 

Gain additional animal souls through shamanic rituals, quests for Animal Gods, or other esoteric means.


### You Start WIth



*   3 Grit
*   Melee Weapon (d6) 
*   Ranged Weapon (d8, _bulky_)
*   A physical quirk from your Great Soul
*   An inconvenient instinct from your Great Soul


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Nature’s Tongue: You can communicate clearly with animals whose soul you share. You can communicate with difficulty to animals _similar_ to those spirits.
*   Psychopomp: When you are attendant to the death of a creature (caused by you or not) you may temporarily take custody of its soul. You can use your Great Soul ability to take that creature’s form once, but afterwards the soul passes beyond the Black River.
*   Soul Sight: You can blind yourself to the material world to see creature’s souls. You can see, through all but the most powerful of illusions, what sort of creature they are and their mood.
*   Speaker to the Dead: You can consult with the lingering souls and spirits of those who died nearby. Recalcitrant spirits may require offerings or favors before helping.


## Blessed of the Water

_Were you granted a boon by an ocean goddess? Are you the daughter of a river spirit? Perhaps you did some great deed for the guardian of a particular cove? Your watery patron granted you a part of itself and bound you to water. They are not a dominant presence in your journey, but their support is constant and you hear their voice in the patter of rain, the burble of a creek, or the crash of ocean waves._


### Core Ability

A Thing of the Sea: You are equally at home in water as you are on land and you can control a volume of water about the size of a person.

Name your Patron (the spirit, body, or source of water that has claimed you), and choose the blessing it grants (or use a Starter Package).


### Water Blessings



1. Fluid Form: Turn into water, but have only minimal control over your movement (if a liquid you can’t flow uphill, if a gas wind currents dictate your direction).
2. Font of Self: Produce water, about a gallon per hour.
3. Thermo Regulation: Change the state of water in one direction (the states are solid, liquid, and gas).
4. Tip Of The Iceberg: Your water control volume expands 10 fold.
5. Water Sight: The first time you immerse yourself in a body of water you may ask your patron one question about something that water touches.
6. Healing Waters: Stabilize wounds by pouring water over them. Submerge a wound in water for a watch to restore one step of Attribute loss.


### You Start With:



*   3 Grit
*   A waterskin
*   A small, impossible token from your Patron


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Very Blessed: You are granted a second Water Blessing.
*   Water Walk: You (and any companions you choose to bring with you) may leap into a body of water, and emerge from the most recent body of water you were fully submerged in.
*   Liquid Construction: You can shape water into single use tools and equipment. You can also create weapons (d8) that last until they deal Critical Damage, and armor (1 Armor) that lasts until the wearer receives Critical Damage.
*   Water Tongue: You can communicate with any creature that claims water as its home.


## Archivist

_You’ve always liked knowing things. Collecting information and stories like a squirrel collecting nuts for the winter. Frustrated with incomplete, inconsistent, and obviously biased records you’ve emerged from your study to do first hand research and correct the record. _


### Core Ability

Deep Lore: Pick a topic, whenever you first encounter something within that topic you may ask the GM a question about it. The GM will answer truthfully to the extent that the answer is knowable. Further questions require additional study, research, investigation or time.


### You Start With:



*   3 Grit
*   Your Archive (_bulky_): You may take a day to record a new Topic of information into your archive from some source of knowledge (library, archive, storyteller, elder). You may use your Deep Lore ability on any Topic contained in your archive, but only after taking the time to look it up.
*   Wire Rimmed Reading Glasses
*   Knife-Pen (d6) and Ink
*   A _knack_ you picked up during your studies.


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Method of Loci: You’ve memorized your entire Archive. It still takes you time to look things up (walking around your memory palace) but it’s always with you.
*   Monster Manual: Thoroughly examine a creature to add it to your Archive. You have +1 armor against them and may ask questions about them as per Deep Lore. If you’ve added 3 similar creatures, add their Family to your Archives as a Topic.
*   Psychometry: You can read an object’s history just by touching it. When you handle an object you can sense events that have happened to it. Emotionally charged and recent events take precedence, but with careful study you may ask specific questions.
*   Expert Reader: No matter the language, culture, code, cypher, or style you can always quickly discern the intent and meaning of any writing.


## Runewright

_You are a runewright, you imbue and channel power through engraved symbols of power. You are no wizard. You’re above running around shooting crude magic from your fingertips, blasting things with fireballs. Runes are sophisticated. Runes are subtler, slower, and longer lasting than spells. Anyone can pick up a spellbook and cast a spell, crafting runes takes refinement. And you are refined._


### Core Ability

Runic Magic: You can inscribe runes that incorporate one Element, one Verb, and one Subject. Empower and activate an inscribed rune with a drop of your own, fresh blood and a point of Max Grit. You can deactivate a rune at will to recover the spent Max Grit.


### You Start WIth



*   3 Grit
*   Knowledge of 2 Elements, 2 Verbs, and 2 Subjects
*   Hammer (d6) and Chisel (d6)
*   Flawless handwriting


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Expansive Research: Learn the remaining Elements, Verbs and Subjects from the standard lists.
*   Synergistic Conjunctions: You have learned to write runes that incorporate two Elements simultaneously.
*   Rune Logic: You learn to add Modifiers as a fourth component of a rune:
    *   If: Set a condition under which an empowered run will activate.
    *   Not: Invert the effects of the Verb or Element used in a rune.
*   Esoteric Elements: Learn how to manipulate the following two elements in your runes:
    *   Time: dealing with speeding or slowing things
    *   Space: dealing with locations and distances


### Rune Components

Runic magic is subtler than both Spells and Rituals, dealing mostly with modifying existing things. The effects are long lasting, but generally less power.

When you inscribe a rune, tell the GM what your intended effect is and what components you plan to use to achieve that. They’ll tell you if that’s possible, or if you’ll have to do more to achieve your goal.



*   Elements:
    *   Air: breathing, flight, wind
    *   Fire: burning, heat
    *   Earth: stone, weight
    *   Water: liquid, 
*   Verb
    *   Enhance: Addition, amplification
    *   Impair: Reduction, suppression
    *   Move: Motive force, relocation
    *   Create: Production, renewal
    *   Destroy: Removal, decay
*   Subject
    *   Self: relating to the element itself
    *   Object: relating to an inanimate object
    *   Creature: relating to a person or being


## Grimblade

_You are a grimblade and you have a grimblade, a unique and very large weapon that you’ve learned the trick of putting spells in. Whether you physically inscribe it onto a meteor metal blade, or embed the spells into a crystal hammer, you find this eminently more practical than lugging a big book around._


### Core Ability

Grimblade: Your Grimblade acts as a Grimoire. Use STR rather than WIL to cast spells if you have zero Grit. You may cast spells and rituals from it as usual, but additionally if you deal Critical Damage with the weapon you may cast a spell (not ritual) ignoring the usual costs.


### You Start WIth



*   2 Grit
*   Your Grimblade: d10, _bulky_, containing 2 spells of your choice. It is any type of melee weapon, made of some unusual material. Your Grimblade is indestructible, and you always know where it is.
*   Unusual Armor (1 Armor)


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Mystic Strike: Drop your Grit to zero to deal max damage on an attack. You can only do this if you’re not already at zero Grit.
*   Spell Disruption: You can destroy weak (and disrupt powerful) ongoing spells and enchantments with your Grimblade. If there is risk of magical backlash, you can make a STR Save to avoid it.
*   Hammerspace: You can store your Grimblade in a sub dimensional space (a Mary Poppins bag, a small portal, a tattoo, etc.) where it can be retrieved instantly.
*   I, Grimblade: Whether through the magic stored within or from other means, your Grimblade has become sentient and ambulatory. It can float, act, and attack on its own.


## Cleric of Small Gods

_Carry a small god around with you. You protect it, rather than the other way around. Possibly a baby god, a god of a small concept, a recently reincarnated god, a local god whose home was destroyed, or a ‘killed’ god. _


### Core Ability

Words of God: Gods can speak only truth. When you speak with the words of your god the words are either true, or your god’s energy will attempt to _make_ it true. Such statements can only be made within your god’s domain, and carry some risk.


### You Start With



*   3 Grit
*   A Small God - Determine its name, domain, and form.
*   A ceremonial object (d6)
*   Formal vestments


### Statement Stability

The Stability of a statement starts at a d10 for narrow domains, d8 for normal domains, and d6 for broad domains. It is a reflection of how willing the universe is to accept the new truth, the more it clashes with the universe the more unstable it becomes. \
 \
Step down the Stability for each of the following that are true of the statement:



*   It impacts things outside of your line of sight.
*   It directly contradicts the natural working of the world.
*   It describes a long lasting effect (step up twice for permanent).
*   It is a poor fit for your god’s domain.

Step up the Stability for each of the following that are true of the statement:



*   It impacts only things you are touching.
*   It is copacetic with the natural working of the world.
*   It describes a fleeting effect.
*   It is a perfect fit for your god’s domain.

If the Stability steps below a d4, the statement is impossible (the universe will reject it). If the Stability steps above a d12 it takes effect without a roll.

Roll the Stability Die as a normal Save.

Win: The statement takes effect.

Lose: The universe pushes back (i.e. step down WIL, unintended side effects, etc.)

Tie: Both.


### Advanced Advancements

Unlock these abilities by spending 1 + N XP where N is the number of Advanced Abilities you already have.



*   Offerings: Appropriate sacrifices or offerings made to your God will increase Stability, commensurate to the thing being offered.
*   Gemini: Your god has a second domain. It is the mirror of the first, the other side of the coin, or otherwise complementary.
*   Divine Colleagues: Your god can always tell you which (if any) god or spirit claims an area, as well as how to contact them.
*   Holy Site: Spend a week and a suitably impressive offering to create a holy site for your god. It shields those within from outside influence, and alerts you to any malicious interlopers. You may teleport yourself and your companions to this location, but the site loses all benefits until it is re-sanctified with a new offering.
