# Spells

[Random Spell](https://perchance.org/bw-spells)

## Casting Spells
To cast a spell, hold the Grimoire in both hands and read the spell aloud.

If you have Grit, set your Grit to zero to cast the spell.

If you have no Grit, make a WIL Save:

**Win:** The spell is cast successfully.

**Tie:** The spell is cast successfully, but your WIL is stepped down.

**Lose:** Your WIL steps down. Either you are knocked unconscious, or the spell misfires (your choice).

If no duration is listed the spell lasts as long as you continue to hold your Grimoire and concentrate on it, but you’re deprived until you stop.
## Spells In Combat
When you cast a spell against a creature that is actively trying to avoid it, if the spell deals damage simply use that damage as a normal attack.

If the spell does not deal damage, roll your WIL as though it were an attack. If that attack deals Direct Damage, your spell takes effect instead of causing a Critical Damage Save.
